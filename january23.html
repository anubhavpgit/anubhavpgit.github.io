                        Like all good things, my time as a full-stack engineer at <a href="https://squbix.com">Squbix
                            Digital</a> had to come to
                        an end. I'm grateful for the opportunity. I got to work with TypeScript, NodeJs, ReactJs, React
                        Native, Substrate, and Rust and got to learn a ton of new things about the
                        world of Web3, cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications, blockchains, and NFTs and I also
                        got to work on some really cool projects. I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I embarked on an exhilarating trip to two of India's most bustling cities, Mumbai
                        and New Delhi. The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly attending Mood Indigo 2023, the annual
                        cultural extravaganza hosted by IIT Bombay. The experience left me in awe!

                    <p>
                        March had mid-semester exams in stock for me. I thought I wouldn't pull through and fail
                        miserably. (Chill. That didn't happen xD). But as I geared towards preparing for the exams,
                        desperateley trying to collect notes, an immense sense of responsibility dawned upon me. <a>
                            Smruti</a> reminded me that we were supposed to build the half-baked project together that
                        makes notes and academic materials accessible for free and I started on the first day of my exam
                        and completed <a href="https://notes-sit.live/">Resoc</a> on the last day of the exam. (Funny
                        how I managed to find a way not to study enough xD). You can read more about it <a
