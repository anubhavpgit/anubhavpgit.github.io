<p>Like all good things, my time as <a href="https://github.com/anubhab-patnaik">a full-stack engineer</a> at <a href="https://squbix.in">Squbix Digital</a> had to come to an end. I’m grateful for the opportunity. I was tasked with building web and mobile apps to integrate with the blockchain. I got to work with TypeScript, NodeJs, ReactJs, React Native, Substrate, and Rust and got to learn a ton of new things. I got to work with Web3 technologies; cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications, blockchains, and NFTs. I was responsible for refactoring React-Native applications with better UI and implementing offline storage, push notifications, and was tasked with building an internal ERP system to monitor the attendance and tasks of employees. I also built and backend APIs using NodeJs and ExpressJs. I got to tinker with the existing NodeJs code and configured optional parameters to switch between different blockchains, and also refactored the JS-based SDK to TypeScript. We also had to build a Chrome extension, and a PWA for wallet -to- wallet transactions and used mocha for unit testing. In the Polkadtot chain, I modified the existing DID pallet using rust and substrate to store identity information in the blockchain with additional unit tests.</p>
<p>I embarked on an exhilarating trip to two of India’s most bustling cities, Mumbai and New Delhi. The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly attending Mood Indigo 2023, the annual cultural extravaganza hosted by IIT Bombay. The experience left me in awe! I was also the Contigent Leader of my college and also got a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMJChzaUcKUKqYJJW3EEGX2WogZyVPJh/view?usp=sharing">certificate</a>.</p>
<p>I participated in the XIMUN 2023, the annual Model United Nations conference hosted by XIM University, with my go-to co-delegate, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinashprasad-2001/">Avinash</a>. I am thrilled to have bagged the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vTZl3K2kRTJgDgFr3lN5mxSaz7pnwvc2/view?usp=share_link">Best Delegate</a> award at the conference. Our team represented Pakistan in the Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC). We decided to go with Pakistan because representing any other nation or a P5/ NATO nation is relatively more straightforward because there are lesser fingers pointed at you and Pakistan presented a unique challenge due to its reputation for alleged notorious activities. Overall, it was a satisfying victory, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have participated.</p>
<p>I am looking to write blogs/papers on ‘String Theory’ soon. I have always been intrigued by the theory and couldn’t get my head to wrap around it. However, now that my college years are ending, I plan to dedicate my time to writing about it. Another topic that I wanted to work on is ‘Natural Language Models’. I intend to delve deeper into exploring how exactly natural language models work, the neural networks behind them, and some of the most popular models based on transformer architecture, like BERT, and GPT-3. You’re always welcome to reach out if you want to collaborate on any of these topics.</p>

<p>I am modifying zuzu to port my <a href="https://anubhavp.dev/paperblog">blog</a> (written in Hugo) to <a href="https://anubhavp.dev/zuzu">zuzu</a>. This entire site and the blog are now built using zuzu. Zuzu is a custom static site generator written in JavaScript. It includes static files compilation, dynamic search, and a rss feed generator. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu">here</a>. Currently it is in a very early stage of development, and it is designed to work like a basic static site generator. But it can be modified to cater to your need easily.</p>
<p>March had mid-semester exams in stock for me. I thought I wouldn’t pull through and fail miserably. (Chill. That didn’t happen xD). But as I geared towards preparing for the exams, desperateley trying to collect notes, a sense of responsibility dawned upon me. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smruti-dash-1210/">khusi</a> reminded me that we were supposed to build the half-baked project together that makes notes and academic materials accessible for free and I started on the first day of my exam and completed <a href="https://resoc.in/">Resoc</a> on the last day of the exam. (Funny how I managed to find a way not to study enough xD). You can read more about it <a href="https://anubhavp.dev/blog/resoc.html">here</a>. We acquired a user base of 96 with an avg engagement time of 3m14s and more than 2980 reads within a week of launch! We are looking for active contributors interested in contributing their notes.</p>

<p>With the end of the semester approaching, I am looking forward to a much-needed break. However, this impending respite also brings with it the realization that my time in college, particularly with my friends, is dwindling. My mind races back to those initial days, when I struggled to  introduce myself to seniors and make friends. Those moments, in retrospect, were the extent of my worries back then!</p>
<p>Today, the landscape of my concerns has transformed exponentially. Each morning, as I wake up, a whirlwind of thoughts engulfs my mind. I become aware that there is an overwhelming number of challenges and dilemmas that I may never fully resolve.</p>
<p>Now, standing at the crossroads between the present and the future, I’m confronted with the weight of responsibilities and uncertainties. The path to adulthood feels daunting, and the magnitude of the challenges can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>As the days of college slip away, I’m determined to make the most of the time I have left. I cherish the friendships I’ve formed and know that they may change but will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as I gear up to graduate this year, I am actively scouring the web for compelling summer internship opportunities.</p>
