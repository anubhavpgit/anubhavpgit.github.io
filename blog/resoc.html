                <p>RESOC lets you share notes, question papers, and other academic resources with your friends and classmates. It’s a free and open-source platform, built by a bunch of tech-savvy students at Silicon Institute, Bhubaneswar.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-all-started" tabindex="-1">How it all started</h2>
<p>The idea came to me in the first year of my undergrad, when I found myself scouring the internet for notes, and calling up friends in the middle of the night. I have a terrible habit of studying just before the exam, and at the end of the day, I always find myself having nothing to read from. This led me to build a Google Drive collection that became an instant hit among my peers. Everybody wanted the link! I didn’t bother to put much effort into it, and it was just a bunch of collection of notes that I had collected over the years. I built a static html page and hosted it in GitHub pages at that time that contained the links.</p>
<h2 id="the-journey" tabindex="-1">The Journey</h2>
<p>Cut to December 2021- January 2022. I was experimenting with development using NodeJs and ReactJs and was trying to build something meaningful. I built an authentication management app using Firebase. I wanted to build something cool that would use the authentication system, and I built a chat application, using Firebase. I loved the site but I kept thinking about how I could improve the application and slowly started adding features until I realized that I had essentially created a mini social media platform that could potentially help students in a big way. The initial name for the platform was notes.sit. I added a task management component, and my older html page, on top of everything I had built so far. The website was working, students always asked for the links and it became popular.</p>
<p>A year late, admist all the placement chaos, I had completeley forgotten about RESOC. <a href="https://github.com/smrutid12">Smruti Dash</a> reminded me that I had always wanted to complete that project and build the best, free, and open-source (FOSS) website that could potentially help students. I wanted to add tons of features to notes.sit, add markdown support, a search bar, a better UI with excellent user experience, and customizable sections that fetch free data from the college ERP to make it feel more like home. I wanted to make it more RESOC. Together, we started with the UI and changed everything. I designed the UI by building on the older interface and implemented best design practices. We slowly took each component, loaded it with tons of features, and kept on improving it, until we looked back to see what we have accomplished.</p>

<h2 id="resoc" tabindex="-1">RESOC</h2>
<p>The best notes-sharing platform around, built by a bunch of tech-savvy students at Silicon Institute, and it’s totally free. We have a nifty task section for you to manage your work. No more forgetting deadlines and drowning in assignments. Pop over to the community chat page and give us a holler. We’re always happy to help out and connect with like-minded folks. You might even make a new study buddy or two :)</p>
<p>As we continue to develop RESOC, our goal is to create a platform that feels like home to our users. We want to cater to your academic needs, and let you access important data when you need them. We’ve already added a ton of features, but we’re always looking for ways to make the platform even more user-friendly.</p>
<p>We don’t charge you anything for the notes, but you could always consider buying us pizza! ;)</p>
