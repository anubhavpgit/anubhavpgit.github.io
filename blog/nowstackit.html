<h3 id="automation" tabindex="-1">Automation</h3>
<p>Say hello to our automation feature that lets you sit back, relax, and watch the magic happen! With StackIt, you can automate the import of data from your trusted data sources straight into your Google Sheets. We’re all about saving you time and effort, so we give you the power to set up <code>schedules</code> that fit your data-importing groove. Want to import data <code>daily</code> to keep your Sheets up-to-date? No problemo! Need it <code>hourly</code> to satisfy your data-hungry soul? We’ve got you covered! Or perhaps a <code>weekly</code> import is more your style? You got it!</p>
<p>StackIt also allows you to set up <code>alerts</code> to notify you when a specific event occurs, like a new customer being added to your database. It’s like having your own data detective on the case, making sure you never miss a beat.</p>
<h3 id="integrations" tabindex="-1">Integrations</h3>
<p>StackIt is the ultimate data source whisperer! We’ve got a growing list of data sources that we play nice with, and we’re always expanding our repertoire. Currently, we’re bosom buddies with:</p>

<p>StackIt believes in giving you the power to be a data ninja, slicing and dicing your way to data greatness! With our awesome filtering features, you can wave your virtual wand and import only the data that truly matters to you.</p>
<p>Before you even hit that “import” button, StackIt treats you to a sneak peek of your data in the <code>preview section</code>. It’s like taking a peek into a treasure chest before deciding which gems to bring into your Google Sheets. In this preview section, you can <code>sort</code> and <code>filter</code> your data to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>We’ve got a filter arsenal that would make a coffee connoisseur proud. Need to import data only from customers who have subscribed to your service? No problemo! Just unleash the mighty <code>subscription_status</code> filter, and voila! The non-subscribers vanish, and you’re left with the cream of the crop.</p>
<h3 id="natural-language-query-coming-soon" tabindex="-1">Natural Language Query <em>(Coming Soon)</em></h3>
<p>With StackIt, you don’t need to be fluent in “geek-speak” or SQL wizardry to get the answers you seek from your data. We’ve made it super easy and friendly by allowing you to query your data using natural language. StackIt, with our trusty sidekick, <code>LookupAi</code>, employs the power of Natural Language Processing. That’s right, we’ve given StackIt a big brain that can understand your questions and provide you with the exact answers you need.</p>
<p>Imagine asking StackIt, “Hey, how many awesome customers have subscribed to my mind-blowing service?” StackIt will magically deliver the answer right to your fingertips. StackIt understands your questions, just like a helpful friend would! You can ask specific questions like, “How many customers have subscribed to my service in the last 30 days?” or get a broader overview with a question like, “Tell me the total count of super happy customers.”</p>

<p>StackIt is all about making your data-importing experience as smooth as possible.

Bring in data from Chargebee, PostgreSQL, Stripe, and more, and let them mingle and share their insights in one centralized space. No more flipping back and forth between different spreadsheets or struggling to manually merge data.</p>
