SIT Campus

<p>As I stand here on the cusp of graduating, gazing upon the halls and pathways that have become my home for the past four years, a swirl of emotions engulfs me. My heart feels heavy with this melancholy as I roam around this campus for the final time. Every nook and corner of this campus holds a special place in my heart. Every memory, every laugh, every tear has been etched into these walls. And now, as I take my final steps through these corridors, I can feel a sense of separation looming over me. It’s hard to let go of something that has been a part of your life for so long.</p>
<p>As I walk past the classrooms where we were always late, a pang of nostalgia engulfs me. The same classrooms where we listened to lectures with half attention, where we struggled to keep our eyes open during the post-lunch sessions, and where we made friends. As I stand at the back of the room and look at the empty seats, I can hear the echo of our conversations. The long hours spent with our lab partners, trying to make sense of the experiments, the fear of lab tests, the laughter and the frustration - all of it comes flooding back. As I walk past these memories, I feel a sense of loss. I am leaving behind a part of myself.</p>
<p>It feels like only yesterday that I was a wide-eyed fresher, stepping onto campus for the first time. I was in my mind a tech hero, filled with adrenaline prepared to win and rule. As I stepped into the world of unknown and grown-ups, I realized I had a lot to learn. I was a small fish in a big lake, and I had to learn to swim. I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of people, the hustle and bustle of the campus, and the endless possibilities that lay ahead of me. I remember the days I used to walk around with an ID card hanging. I remember how we used to hang out in a corner, bragging about how we are going to change the world upon graduating. I remember hopping on the evening bus to visit the market with my friends. We’d eat a ton while discussing the everyday nuances of our college lives. We used to participate in events, give out interviews for clubs, help organize events and hang out late with seniors.</p>
<p>I yearn to go back to the first year and walk through the gate again. I long to don those ID cards once again and stand with my friends at T-Square as we reminisce about our first-year experiences. I want to get asked to demonstrate riding bikes, ask a senior’s name in the proper format given, and pry on our classmates and get their numbers for the seniors. I wish I could attend classes again, get sent outside for disturbing, run in sweaty formals, enter the chilled CS labs, and sit there staring blankly at the screens. Looking back, I can’t help but smile at the memories.</p>

<p>Now that most of my friends have moved on, I miss going to ABD with them, not worrying about the future, and rambling about the terrible college we studied in and the magic we’d have done had we been running the college. I want to keep discussing what we should wear to Zygon and Rythmnova, and whether we’d need to wear our ID cards at night. As I walk past the hostel gates, memories flood back of us staying together, sharing each other’s shirts, shampoos, and snacks, and using one hairdryer among two hundred people. The late nights spent in the hostel corridors talking about life, family, the future, movies, and music were magical. The evening’s borrowing speakers ensured that now none of us sleep. The exam nights we used to go to anybody’s room and ask them for a few pointers and questions, and then they wouldn’t know too (well because they are my friends, what else do you expect ? :D) and then we would go down knocking on other rooms are days I will cherish forever.</p>
<p>As we bid farewell to each other, we make promises to stay in touch, meet, and gossip. We know in our hearts that these are sweet, generous lies that we tell ourselves. Life happens. We move on and learn to live without each other.</p>
<p>I am filled with bittersweet nostalgia as I reflect on the journey that led me here, the friends I have made, and the experiences I have had. As I pen these words, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my alma mater and everyone who has been a part of my journey. I can’t help but wonder about my choices and the roads I’ve taken during this journey. It has been a time of growth, discovery, and unforgettable memories. I bid adieu to this cherished chapter of my life and reflect on the moments that have made it unforgettable. My silicontites, I will cherish you for a lifetime. While it is bittersweet to say goodbye to this phase of my life, I eagerly look forward to embarking on a new chapter. With my sights set on new horizons, I am excited to see where life takes me and what the future holds.</p>
