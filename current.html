                        I have planned something exciting for me to hop onto once my college gets over. My primary
                        priority still remains the same, that is to get a job in one of the top tech companies, and work
                        on projects that I am really passionate about. While I go and hunt, <a
                            href="https://injuly.in">Srijan</a> and I have planned to start something of our own! The
                        egg has just been laid and we have still a lot of figuring out to do, but I am really excited
                        about it. We are still in extremely early stages, but I will keep you posted.

                        As I near the end of my four-not-so-long-year college journey, it feels like the end of an era.
                        Looking
                        back, I am filled with immense gratitude for the incredible experiences and memories that I have
                        garnered throughout my college life. I made lifelong friends, discovered
                        new passions, and grew both personally and professionally.

                        While it is bittersweet to say goodbye to this phase of my life, I am eagerly looking forward to
                        embarking on a new chapter. With my sights set on new horizons, I am excited to see where life
                        takes me and to see what the future holds.

                        I am exploring my options and scouring for opportunities. I intend to work with the biggest tech
                        companies, building products and creating differences.
