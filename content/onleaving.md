# Leaving StackIt, 2023

As with every good journey, there comes an end. I've wrapped up my tenure at StackIt after six fulfilling months. December serves as the last month of my journey at StackIt. I've had a great time working at StackIt. The experience was invaluable, teaching me a great deal and providing opportunities for growth. I'm grateful for the chance to have been a part of it.
