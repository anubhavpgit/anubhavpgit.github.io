As I stand here on the cusp of graduating and bidding farewell to my alma mater, I can't help but wonder about my choices and the roads I've taken during this journey. As I walk past, I see a million memories carved everywhere. It has been a time of growth, discovery, and unforgettable memories, but now it's time to bid adieu and embark on a new path.

Standing here, gazing upon the halls and pathways that have become my home for the past four years, a swirl of emotions engulfs me. My heart feels heavy with this melancholy as I roam around for the final time. Every nook and corner of this campus holds a special place in my heart. Every memory, every laugh, every tear has been etched into these walls. And now, as I take my final steps through these corridors, I can feel a sense of separation looming over me. It's hard to let go of something that has been a part of your life for so long.

I walk past the classrooms where we were always late. The same classrooms where we listened to lectures with half attention, where we struggled to keep our eyes open during the post-lunch sessions, and where we made friends. As I stand at the back of the room and look at the empty seats, I can hear the echo of our conversations. The labs are now a source of nostalgia. The long hours spent with our lab partners, trying to make sense of the experiments, the constant fear of not getting the desired results, the laughter and the frustration - all of it comes flooding back. I can still stare at the blank screens with no code and wait for a guy somewhere coding in the lab to send the code to the Whatsapp group. As I walk past these memories, I can't help but feel a sense of loss. I am leaving behind a part of myself.

It feels like only yesterday that I was a wide-eyed fresher, stepping onto campus for the first time. I was in my mind a tech hero, filled with adrenaline prepared to win and rule. As I stepped into the world of unknown and grown-ups, I realized I had a lot to learn. I was a small fish in a big pond, and I had to learn to swim. I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of people, the hustle and bustle of the campus, and the endless possibilities that lay ahead of me. I remember the days I used to walk around with an ID card hanging, wishing that no one would notice the slippers I am styling. I remember the time we used to chill in some corner bragging about how we are going to change the world upon graduating. I remember hopping on the evening bus to go out to the nearby markets with my friends. We went to eat and buy stuff, while we'd discuss the everyday nuances of our college lives. We used to participate in events, give out interviews for clubs and hang out late with seniors. Looking back, I can't help but smile at the memories.

I watch the new batch of students enter through the college gates with their freshly minted ID cards, and I can't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. I long to don those ID cards once again and stand with my friends at T-Square as we reminisce about our first-year experiences. I want to get asked to demonstrate riding bikes, ask a senior's name in the proper format given, and pry on our classmates and get their numbers for the seniors. As I look at them running with records in their hands, I am filled with a fit of bittersweet jealousy and nostalgia. I yearn to back to the first year and walk through the gate once again. I wish I could attend classes again, and get sent outside for disturbing the class. I long to run in sweaty formals and enter the chilled CS labs and sit there and stare blankly at the screens.

Now that most of my friends have moved on, I miss going to ABD with them, not worrying about the future, and rambling about the terrible college we studied in and the wonders we'd do once we graduated. I want to keep discussing what we should wear to Zygon, Rythmnova, and whether we need to wear our ID cards at night. As I walk past the hostel gates, memories flood back of us staying together, sharing each other's shampoos and soaps, and using one hairdryer among two hundred people.

I want to buy a hairdryer and let my friends use it as long as they want. I want to visit their offices and ask them to play PUBG all night all over again. The late nights spent in the hostel corridors talking about life, family, the future, movies, and music were magical.  The evening's borrowing speakers made sure that now none of us sleep. The exam nights we used to go to anybody's room and ask them for a few pointers and questions, and then they wouldn't know too( well because they are my friends, what else do you expect ? :D) and then we would go down knocking on other rooms are days I will cherish forever. I wish I could do it all over again.

As we bid farewell to each other, we make promises to stay in touch, meet, and gossip. We know it in our hearts that these are sweet, generous lies that we tell ourselves. Life happens. We move on and learn to live without each other.

I am filled with bittersweet nostalgia as I reflect on the journey that led me here, the friends I have made, and the experiences I have had. As I pen these words, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my alma mater and everyone who has been a part of my journey. I bid adieu to this cherished chapter of my life and reflect on the moments that have made it unforgettable. My silicontites, I will cherish all of you for a lifetime. While it is bittersweet to say goodbye to this phase of my life, I am eagerly looking forward to embarking on a new chapter. With my sights set on new horizons, I am excited to see where life takes me and to see what the future holds.
