This post is a recent life update. I hope this helps those who need this. Life, the Universe, and Everything is a book by Douglas Adams, and this post is a **not** related to it. It is about my journey over the past couple of months. I don't honestly know how to put things into perspective, or how to write about what I have been going through.

This is a first for me. I have always written about all the positive things in my life, the happenings, the adventures.
