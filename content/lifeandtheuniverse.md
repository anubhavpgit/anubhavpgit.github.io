This is a recent life update. It tries to shed insight into what I have been going through for the past couple of months, and how I have been dealing with it. In the midst of the whirlwind of emotions, finding the right words seems like catching a lightining in a bottle. I have always been the one to share the highs, the adventures, the trips, and the zeal to power through. But now, as I peer into the shadows that have crept into my days, I find myself at a loss. I don't know where to begin writing or how to put things into perspective. This is to say that I might be bad at this, and I ask you to bear with me.

So here's the deal: This post will be long. I'm not promising any grand revelations or profound insights. This isn't going to be a masterpiece of prose. It's just me, reaching out to anyone who might need to hear that they're not alone in their struggles. Because sometimes, just knowing that someone else is stumbling through the darkness alongside you can make all the difference.
