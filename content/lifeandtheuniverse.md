This post is a recent life update. It tried to shed insight on what I have been going through, and how I have dealt with it. I hope this helps those who need this. Life, the Universe, and Everything is a book by Douglas Adams, and this post is a **not** related to it. It is about my journey over the past couple of months.

This is a first for me. I have always written about all the positive things in my life, the happenings, the adventures. I don't honestly know how to write about what I have been going through, put things into perspective. This is to say that I might be bad at this, but I hope you forgive my shortcomings in writing this post.
