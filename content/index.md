Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a CS engineer from India. Interested in math, science, and engineering, I work with software engineering and try to solve real-world problems. This is a space where I publish my thoughts and ideas. I write about tech, science, and my life. [Here's my background](/background.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](/current.html).

I work with whatever piques my interest. I used to dabble in ML and now work with web, mobile, and CMD applications. Currently, I am preparing for interviews, and I polish my coding skills on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/anubhabr50). I've also been working on a custom bit-torrent client to download files using TypeScript, and I plan on porting it to Rust. Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and will work on a brainfuck interpreter soon. This site (inspired from [blog.matsu.io](https://blog.matsu.io)) is built using [zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu), a custom SSG.

When not coding up a storm, I work with FOSS communities: I conduct workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions. I built and maintain [cbrtl](https://cbrtl.github.io), a FOSS platform for students to showcase their work and get recognition for their work.

Besides, I love listening to music, watching sci-fi, sitcoms, fantasy and thriller, and reading books. I have recently started playing the guitar, and I have been reading the [Remembrance of Earth's Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) by Liu Cixin. I love to travel and [click a lot of photos](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks). I attend seminars on space exploration, life in space, and physics, participate in debates and MUNs and dabble in freelance graphic design. Whether geeky, nerdy, or creative, I'm always up for it!
