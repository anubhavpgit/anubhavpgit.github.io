Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India. Interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I work with software engineering and try to solve real-world problems. Currently, I am building [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com) as the founding engineer in Bangalore, IN. This is a space where I publish my thoughts and ideas. I write about tech and my life. [Here's my journey](/cv.html).

I am working on a pet project, [Dough](https://fuzzymfx/dough): a rich, modular, and customisable content generator, written in Rust. I will be picking back up [Bee](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b), a bit-torrent client that I started working on a while back. This site (inspired by [blog.matsu.io](https://blog.matsu.io)) is built using [zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu), a SSG written in JS.

Besides, I love music and have recently started playing the guitar. I love to [travel](https://anubhavp.dev/explored), [read fiction, journal](https://anubhavp.dev/blog), [click and shoot](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks), and [attend events](https://anubhavp.dev/cv#activities) on space exploration and tech. [Here's more on what I am up to](/current.html).
