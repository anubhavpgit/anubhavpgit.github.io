Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India. Interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I work with software engineering and try to solve real-world problems. This is a space where I publish my thoughts and ideas. I write about tech and my life. [Here's my background](/cv.html).

I am working on a pet project, Dough: a rich, modular, and customisable content generator, written in Rust. I will be picking back up Bee, a [bit-torrent client](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b) that I started working on a while back. Meanwhile, I am building [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com) as the founding engineer.

I am looking to explore esoteric programming languages and look into the brainfuck interpreter. Curious about game dev, I am also looking to get my hands dirty with tactical FPS/ open-world games. This site (inspired by [blog.matsu.io](https://blog.matsu.io)) is built using [zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu), a custom SSG.

Besides, I love music and have recently started playing the guitar and have been reading the [Remembrance of Earth's Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) by Liu Cixin. I love to [travel](https://anubhavp.dev/explored), [write](https://anubhavp.dev/blog), [click and shoot](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks), and [attend events](https://anubhavp.dev/cv#activities) on space exploration and tech. [Here's more on what I am up to](/current.html).
