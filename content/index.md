Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India. Interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I try to solve real-world problems. I live in Bangalore, IN, and am building something of my own. I recently left [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com), where I worked as the founding engineer. Right now, I am between jobs. This is a space where I publish my musings. I write about tech and my life. [Here's my journey](/journey.html).

I am working on a pet project, [Dough](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough): a rich, modular, and customisable content generator, crafted in Rust. Later, I will be reviving [Bee](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b), a bit-torrent client I started working on a while back. Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and the brainfuck interpreter.

[Living in BLR](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/lifeinametro.html) has its toll. The weather and the thriving tech scene in this city are undoubtedly appealing, but the over-population and traffic can be overwhelming. Trying to strike a balance between spending time in the office and doing things that I am more passionate about is a constant pain point.

I enjoy music and have recently taken up playing the guitar. I also have a penchant for [adventuring and exploring places](https://anubhavp.dev/explored). Fond of *fiction*, I am trying to take time out to [read](https://anubhavp.dev/reading.html), and also [journal](https://anubhavp.dev/blog) more. Additionally, I have a [photography page](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks). 

Besides, I [attend events](https://anubhavp.dev/cv#activities) related to space exploration, software engineering, and technology. [Here's more on what I am up to](/current.html).

This site (inspired by [blog.matsu.io](https://blog.matsu.io)) is built using a tailored version of [zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu), a static site generator written in JS. The width is *34rem*, and the font used is *Avenir*. [The source code is available here](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/fuzzymfx.github.io).
