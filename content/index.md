<p> Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a CS engineer from India.
                        Interested in math, science, and engineering, I work with software engineering
                        and try to solve real-world problems. I maintain a <a href="/blog">blog</a> where I publish my
                        thoughts and ideas. I write about tech,
                        science, and my
                        life. <a href="/current.html">Here's</a> what I am upto these days.
                    </p>
                    <p> I work with whatever piques my interest. I used to dabble in ML and now work with web, mobile,
                        and CMD applications. I polish my DS and algo on <a target="_blank" id="leetcode"
                            href="https://leetcode.com/anubhabr50/">Leetcode</a>.
                        This site and the blog are built using my custom SSG, <a target="_blank" id="zuzu"
                            href="https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu">zuzu</a>.
                        Lately, I've been working on a custom bit-torrent client to download files using TypeScript, and
                        I plan on porting
                        it to Rust. Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages
                        and will be working on a brainfuck interpreter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When not coding up a storm, I work with FOSS communities. I work with a community of
                        students and conduct workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions and
                        also provide a platform for students to showcase their skills and get recognition for their
                        work.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides, I love listening to music, watching sci-fi, sitcoms, fantasy and thriller, and reading
                        books. I have recently started playing the guitar, and I have been reading
                        `Remembrance of Earth's Past` by Liu Cixin. I travel and click <a

                            a lot of photos</a>.
                        I attend seminars on space exploration, life in space, and physics. I also participate in
                        debates and MUNs and dabble in freelance
                        graphic design. Whether it's geeky, nerdy, or creative, I'm always up for it!
