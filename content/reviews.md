Thoughts on books read, shows and movies watched


##### Reads

- **[The Three-Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem)** : A science fiction novel about humanity's first contact with an alien civilization. The first book in the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy. The plot is sharp and the cohesive storytelling is excellent, especially for folks like me interested in theoretical and astrophyics. The plot timeline is a bit confusing in the initial chapters, but it fits well once you start reading. I felt the book was a bit long, and the pacing could have been a bit faster. But, overall, it is a brilliant read.

##### Shows

- **[Paatal Lok](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9680440/) - Season 2**: A gripping tale of crime, corruption, and power. Paatal Lok is a testament to the fact that Indian cinema is capable of producing world-class content. The plot and direction win here. The show delves deep into the dark underbelly of society, exploring themes of caste, class, and the human condition. The writing is sharp, the characters are well-developed, and the acting is top-notch. The story development is slightly slow and meandering, it could have improved the writing to reveal obvious plot points earlier and still make it equally or more engaging.
A really good Indie-crime drama that doesn't disappoint and carries on the legacy of the first season.

- **[Ted Lasso](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986410/)**: A comedy-drama series that follows an American football coach who is hired to manage an English football team. The show tends to base its premise on kindness, empathy, and the power of positivity. The characters and their arc are well-written, each fraught with their own insecurities and vulnerabilities. The humour is heartwarming; it's a reminder that sometimes, all you need is a little bit of optimism to make things better. But, the show is not without its flaws. The plot can be predictable and too "unrealistic" at times. A team struggling to win games suddenly becomes a winning team because of one coach (and a couple of others), and that too who doesn't know anything about football. It could have been a little more realistic and believable in its portrayal of the real world.

- **[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/)** : I have a lot to unpack here. A comedy-drama series about a housewife who becomes a stand-up comedian in the 1950s. The writing is extremely sharp - it carries the show. The characters are well-developed, and the humour is brilliant- the standup "acts" do not disappoint and feel funny - not forced. The jokes feel natural and the delivery is spot on, like you'd see in a real stand-up act in a show. The Jewish culture is well-represented, and the jokes are the creme de la creme. They explore Midge's personal life, her relationships, her husband cheating on her, her parents' disapproval of her career choice, and her struggles with her career. They explore the themes of feminism and identity. The old New York cinematography is stunning and the design and costumes are visually enchanting. Running parallels, Midge's wins feel personal here; well-deserved. 

	The overall pacing works, though certain subplots lack development. Cases of narrative neglect are when Midge's children are not given enough screen time or development, or how suddenly, one of them grows up to be a brilliant scientist, the other grows up to be a farmer. It might have benefitted from exploring their journeys and anchoring the story towards strengthening these a bit more. Sophie Lenon was a weird caricature, and her arc from the background to trying to establish prominence in standup was a bit forced. Lenny Bruce, a mentor/ friend/ fellow Jewish comedian had a good growth arc, but making him a love interest was a bit of a stretch. The show's ending might have been a bit rushed; the parents' characters seem to suddenly be okay and supportive of Midge's career, and Midge who had a single husband suddenly had four marriages. The ending felt abrupt but still satisfying. The show is a delightful watch, and I loved it!


- **[Better Call Saul](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476/)** : A prequel to Breaking Bad, about the life of Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer who eventually becomes the sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman. It is a slow burn, but the character development is phenomenal. The show is an absolute masterclass in storytelling, with its intricate plot and well-developed characters. The cinematography is stunning, the scenes shot in the desert, showcasing New Mexico and the South American cultural elements feel real, not overdone. The acting is just top-notch. Bob's brilliant versatility is subtle and nuanced- the slow burn of Jimmy McGill and the rise of immoral Saul is a delight. In a particular season, there's this scene where Jimmy has to convince the board to let him reinstate his license. The way he manipulates the situation by tapping a numb spot using his own dead brother's name is just brilliant. Kim's expression is evident when she realises Jimmy has no remorse for what he did and in fact, enjoyed doing it.

	The show does an excellent job of building tension and suspense, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The ending is satisfying and ties up all loose ends. The only issue that I personally felt was the pace. It is painstakingly slow, and I totally would get it if you don't feel the same way. My issue might have stemmed from the fact that I watched in 2024-25, and the current trend is fast-paced, crisp storytelling, like say "Severance" or "The Bear". It takes a while to get going, and the first few seasons can feel like a slog. The show is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of character-driven stories, it is definitely worth a watch.


<!-- - **Gossip Girl** *- Josh Schwartz*: A teen drama series about privileged high school students in New York City. It's a guilty pleasure, and I admit I was a bit sceptical about watching this show; I usually avoid dramas like this. 

The show is a guilty pleasure, with its over-the-top drama and glamorous lifestyle. The characters are well-developed, and the acting is decent. The plot is predictable at times, but it is still entertaining. The show does an excellent job of exploring themes of friendship, love, and betrayal. The writing is sharp, and the humour is witty. The show is a bit unrealistic at times, but it is still enjoyable. -->
