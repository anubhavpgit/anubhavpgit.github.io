Thoughts on books read, shows, and movies watched recently.


##### Reads

- **[The Three-Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem)**: A science fiction novel about humanity's first contact with an alien civilization. The first book in the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy. The plot is sharp, and the cohesive storytelling is excellent, especially for folks like me interested in theoretical and astrophysics. The plot timeline is a bit confusing in the initial chapters, but it fits well once you start reading. I felt the book was a bit long, and the pacing could have been a bit faster. But, overall, it is a good read.

##### Shows

- **[Severance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/)**: A sci-fi thriller about a company that uses a procedure to sever the memories of its employees, creating a divide between their work and personal lives. The show is a mind-bending exploration of identity, memory, and the nature of work. The cinematography is stunning, with its sleek and sterile office environment contrasting with the chaos/normalcy of the outside world. It’s a surreal and unsettling experience, with its eerie atmosphere and haunting score. What stands out to me is the show’s ability to blend science fiction with cult drama, creating this unique narrative. The characters are well-developed, and the performances are top-notch. It leads the audience to build their own narrative of morality and ethics. The performances are brilliant, so much so that I hate Milchick from the bottom of my heart.

	The pacing is slow, but it builds sufficient tension and gripping suspense effectively. It can be a bit confusing at times. The plot is complex and can be hard to follow and make sense of. I still do not clearly understand Irving’s character and how he came to figure out the map of the office. Or what the deal with Burt and his life is about. Maybe these are suspense elements to be explored later. The episodes release weekly, and the plot requires enough attention to be followed closely; thus, half of my objectivity was lost when I was trying to figure out what happened earlier to make sense of the current episode. I would suggest binge-watching it to not miss out on the details, but a solid watch.

	[*Apple TV+’s “Severance” has officially been renewed for a third season.*](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2025/03/praise-kier-apples-global-hit-emmy-and-peabody-award-winning-workplace-thriller-severance-lands-season-three-renewal/#:~:text=Apple%20TV%2B's%20award%2Dwinning%20series,be%20well%20at%20Lumon%20Industries.)

- **[Ted Lasso](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986410/)**: A comedy-drama series that follows an American football coach who is hired to manage an English football team. The show’s premise is kindness, empathy, and the power of positivity. The characters and their arc are well-written, each fraught with their insecurities and vulnerabilities. The humour is heartwarming; it’s a reminder that sometimes, all you need is a little bit of optimism to make things better. It explores complex themes of mental health, relationships, teamwork and positivity, and has been critically acclaimed for its writing and direction, for its sheer optimism and heartfulness.

	But the show is not without its flaws. The plot can be “unrealistic” at times: a team struggling to win games suddenly becomes a winning team because of one coach (and a couple of others), and that too, who doesn’t know anything about football. Overall, it still does an excellent job, but maybe could have been a little more realistic and believable in its portrayal of the real world.

- **[The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/)**: I have a lot to unpack here. A comedy-drama series about a housewife who becomes a stand-up comedian in the 1950s. The writing is extremely sharp - it carries the show. The characters are well-developed, and the humour is brilliant- the standup “acts” do not disappoint and feel funny, not forced, like you’d see in a real stand-up act in a show. The Jewish culture is well-represented, and the jokes are the crème de la crème. They explore Midge’s personal life, her relationships, her husband cheating on her, her parents’ disapproval of her career choice, and her struggles with her career. The show explores the themes of feminism and identity. Running parallels, Midge’s wins feel personal here; well-deserved. Midge’s journey from a housewife to a successful comedian is one to look up to.

	The overall pacing works, though certain subplots lack development. Cases of narrative neglect are when Midge’s children are not given enough screen time or development, or how suddenly, one of them grows up to be a brilliant scientist, while the other grows up to be a farmer. It might have benefited from exploring their journeys and anchoring the story towards strengthening these a bit more. Sophie Lenon was a weird caricature, and her arc from the background to trying to establish prominence in standup was a bit forced. Lenny Bruce, a mentor/ friend/ fellow Jewish comedian, had a good growth arc, but making him a love interest was a bit of a stretch. The show’s ending might have been a bit rushed; the parents’ characters seem to suddenly be okay and supportive of Midge’s career, and Midge, who had a single husband, suddenly had four marriages. Albeit abrupt, it was still satisfying. The show was a delight.


- **[Better Call Saul](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476/)**: A prequel to Breaking Bad, about the life of Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer who eventually becomes the sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman. It is a slow burn, but the character development is phenomenal. The show is an absolute masterclass in storytelling, with its intricate plot and well-developed characters. The cinematography is stunning, the scenes shot in the desert, showcasing New Mexico and the South American cultural elements, feel real, not overdone. The acting is just top-notch. Bob’s brilliant versatility is subtle and nuanced- the slow burn of Jimmy McGill and the rise of immoral Saul is a delight. In a particular season, there’s this scene where Jimmy has to convince the board to let him reinstate his license. The way he manipulates the situation by tapping a numb spot using his own dead brother’s name is just brilliant. Kim’s expression is evident when she realises Jimmy has no remorse for what he did and enjoyed doing it.

	The show does an excellent job of building tension and suspense, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The ending is satisfying and ties up all loose ends. The only issue that I felt was the pace. It is painstakingly slow, and I totally would get it if you don’t feel the same way. My issue might have stemmed from the fact that I watched in 2024-25, and the current trend is fast-paced, crisp storytelling, like say “Severance” or “The Bear”. It takes a while to get going, and the first few seasons can feel like a slog. The show is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of character-driven stories, it is worth a watch.
