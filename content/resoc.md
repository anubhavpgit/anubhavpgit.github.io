RESOC lets you share notes, question papers, and other academic resources with your friends and classmates. It’s a free and open-source platform, built by a bunch of tech-savvy students at Silicon Institute, Bhubaneswar.

## How it all started

The idea came to me in the first year of my undergrad, when I found myself scouring the internet for notes, and calling up friends in the middle of the night. I have a terrible habit of studying just before the exam, and at the end of the day, I always find myself having nothing to read from. This led me to build a Google Drive collection that became an instant hit among my peers. Everybody wanted the link! I didn’t bother to put much effort into it, and it was just a bunch of collection of notes that I had collected over the years. I built a static html page and hosted it in GitHub pages.

## The Journey

Cut to December 2021- January 2022. I was experimenting with development using NodeJs and ReactJs and was trying to build something meaningful. I built an authentication management app using Firebase. I wanted to build something cool that would use the authentication system, and I built a chat application, using Firebase. I loved the site and I kept thinking about ways to improve it. I kept on adding features until I realized that I had essentially created a mini social media platform that could potentially help students in a big way. The initial name for the platform was notes.sit. I added a kanaban board, and my older html page, on top of everything I had built so far.

A year late, admist all the placement chaos, I had completeley forgotten about RESOC. [Smruti Dash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smruti-dash-1210/) reminded me that I always wanted to complete that half-baked project and build the best, free and open-source (FOSS) website. I wanted to add tons of features to notes.sit, add a markdown support (maybe), a search bar, a better UI with excellent user experience, and customizable sections that fetch free data from the college ERP to make it feel more like home. I wanted to make it more RESOC. Our mid-terms began and while looking for ways not to study, I started building Resoc xD. Together, we started with the UI and changed everything. We designed the UI by building on the older interface and implemented best design practices. We slowly took each component, loaded it with tons of features, and kept on improving it, until we looked back to see what we have accomplished.
