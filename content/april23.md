##### April- June, 2023

--- **June** ---

Moving to Bangalore has been tough. The sheer number of people and the traffic is overwhelming. Coming from a place where I had my own room, spent a ton of time with my friends, and had a lot of time to myself, it's been a bit of a challenge to settle down here. I have been trying to get used to the city, and it's been almost a month since I moved here, and [here's what it's like](/blog/lifeinametro.html).

While adapting to this new environment, at StackIt things have been going great. The product is in a very early stage, so the sheer amount of effort that goes into building the product is immense. The workload is a lot, and it's difficult to figure out where time passes by. Looking back, I see that it's already July, and it feels as if I had just joined a few days back!

I have been actively engaged in client-side development using React and Google App Script while waiting for the setup of the development environment. The backend is written in NodeJs and [here's more on how StackIt operates](/blog/stackit.tech.html). Though I have been enjoying working with React, the client-side development env is wrecked, and it takes a lot of time; To render changes I always need to do a test deployment. The code is written by someone before me, and it's challenging to understand the workflow, and I have been trying to get a hang of it since I joined. I have already shipped a few features and bug fixes, and I am looking forward to working on the backend.

I am looking out for side work and got part-time work as a full-stack developer at Asymmetri. I am working on a project that renders PDFs based on the user input. To accomplish this, I am working with React, Vite, Next.js, and Firebase as the technology stack. While I'm considering Bootstrap for the UI, I haven't finalized the decision just yet.

I got an internship at [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com). I intend to work with web applications and set up CI/CD and data pipelines.

*"At StackIt, we wish to take Spreadsheets into a new era. We are building the next-generation spreadsheet automation platform that will empower 1 billion+ business users to use spreadsheets as their business OS. StackIt is a Google Sheets Editor Plugin. Business teams can rely on StackIt to pull data from popular SaaS tools & internal databases like Chargebee, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc regularly on spreadsheets. They can further analyze and build workflows & dashboards on top of it using StackIt."* - [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com).

Thus, will be moving to Bangalore for the next couple of months. I may be **off the grid for a while** but will be back soon. Excited and looking forward to working with the team at StackIt in Bangalore.

I recently visited Bangalore and met with my friends; to explore and pursue a new idea. We had a great time, and I look forward to meeting them again. New Idea: I have planned something exciting for me to hop onto once my college gets over. My primary priority remains the same, to work with one of the top tech companies and work on projects I am passionate about. While I go and hunt, [Srijan](https://injuly.in) and I have planned to start something of our own! The egg has just been laid, and we have a lot of figuring out to do, but I am excited about it.

I hosted a session, [Git Groove](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anubhabpatnaik0530_git-groove-getting-into-the-rhythm-of-version-activity-7050527332519862272-jniz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop): Getting into the rhythm of version control with Git & GitHub, with the UnStop Chapter of SIT, BBS and it was a huge success. We are planning to host a more advanced session on Git and GitHub shortly. There's also a web development workshop coming up.

Meanwhile, at IEEE, we arranged a talk show with Ramneek Kalra that focused on getting to know IEEE and its benefits. The IEEE Students Chapter is dedicated to promoting knowledge and understanding of engineering. It is run by students and offers a variety of benefits, including networking opportunities, access to cutting-edge research, and professional development resources.

I am still looking to write papers on String Theory and LLMs. Haven't gotten around to it yet.

Books:

- Remembrance of Earth's Past: The Trilogy
  - ~~The three body problem~~
  - The dark forest
  - Death's end
- My Gita
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Binge:

- ~~Superstore~~

- Cont. Umbrella Academy
- ~~Lockwood & Co.~~
- ~~Kim Convenience Store~~

Lately, I've been working on a custom bit-torrent client to download files and movies based on recommendations from my [movie recommendation system](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/Movie-recommendation) and a [movie rating prediction system](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/Movie-rating-prediction). I'm planning to port it to Rust later.

Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and will work on a brainfuck interpreter.

With a few days left in Bhubaneswar, I decided to gift [Smruti](https://smrutidash.com) a domain( smrutidash.com ) and build her portfolio website that she had been trying to build for a couple of months now. I got the domain from Porkbun and looked for open-source portfolios until I stumbled upon [this one](https://seyi.dev/); a simple portfolio website built using HTML, Locomotive Scroll, gsap, and SCSS.

Dev:

- [BitTorrent client]( https://github.com/fuzzymfx/bee)
  - ~~Implement magnet link parsing using `magnet-uri`~~
  - ~~Attempt downloading torrent files and links using `webttorrent client`~~
  - ~~Write bencode parser in typescript~~
  - Build a TCP client to download files from the `trackers array` of the decoded bencode file.
    - Establish a connection with peers.
    - Request a piece of a file.
    - Download the piece and verify its integrity.
    - Repeat until the file has been downloaded.
    - Combine the pieces.
- [Space Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Impact)
  - Research game development
  - Research LÃ–VE & Lua
- Research: [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
- ~~[Portfolio Website](https://smrutidash.com)~~
  - ~~Get Smruti a domain (smrutidash.com)~~
  - ~~Search for open-source portfolios with interactive and animated CSS with a lot of design specifications~~
  - ~~Fork the site and edit it.~~

~~When not coding up a storm, I work with FOSS communities: I conduct workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions. I maintain [cbrtl](https://cbrtl.github.io), a fun open-source platform for students to showcase their work.~~ [My college life is over ;(](/blog/teasquared.html). I am a corporate slave now :|, looking for a job in software engineering and development.

- Striver's [SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)

As I near the end of my four-not-so-long-year college journey, it feels like the end of an era. Looking back, I am filled with immense gratitude for the incredible experiences and memories that I have garnered throughout my college life. I made lifelong friends, discovered new passions, and grew both personally and professionally. [Teasquared](/blog/teasquared.html) is an ode to my alma mater.

Reflecting on my journey, I recently bid adieu to the IEEE Students' Chapter, where I served as the President (Chairperson) for the past year. [Aditya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-viswabhusan/) passed on the torch and I did my best to keep it lit. I am proud of the accomplishments of the chapter and the team that I worked with, and I hope that the chapter continues to grow and thrive in the years to come. I still remember the day [Saurav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurav-jha-4a01341b1/) sir and I established SWITCH, the official coding club of the college. We wanted to establish a coding community for students by conducting workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions. I wish SWITCH all the best with its new management and hope it continues to thrive. I wanted to accomplish a lot with [CBRTL](https://cbrtl.github.io/) but maybe the timing wasn't right. [Srijan](https://injuly.in) and I started cbrtl, a small, tight-knit group of programmers and open-source sorcerers who like to craft fun projects together and build a community. The Social Media Cell was a fun experience. I worked as a photographer, and I was responsible for capturing the moments and memories of the college. We recently had a hearty farewell organized by the whole SSMC team, and hope to stay connected with each other.

While it is bittersweet to say goodbye to this phase of my life, I am eagerly looking forward to embarking on a new chapter. With my sights set on new horizons, I am excited to see where life takes me and to see what the future holds. I am exploring my options and scouring for opportunities. I intend to work with the biggest tech companies, building products and creating differences.
