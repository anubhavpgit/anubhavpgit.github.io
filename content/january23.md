##### January, 2023

Like all good things, my time as a full-stack engineer at [Squbix Digital](https://squbix.in) had to come to an end. I'm grateful for the opportunity. I was tasked with building web and mobile apps to integrate with the blockchain. I got to work with TypeScript, NodeJs, ReactJs, React Native, Substrate, and Rust and got to learn a ton of new things about the world of Web3, cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications, blockchains, and NFTs. I was responsible for refactoring React-Native applications with better UI and implementing offline storage, push notifications, and was tasked with building an internal ERP system to monitor the attendance and tasks of employees. I also built backend APIs using NodeJs. I modified NodeJs code and cnfigured optional parameters to switch between different blockchains, also refactored the JS-based SDK to TypeScript. We built a Chrome extension, and a PWA for wallet -to- wallet transactions and used mocha for unit testing. I modified the existing DID pallet using rust and substrate to store identity information in the blockchain with additional unit tests.

I embarked on an exhilarating trip to two of India's most bustling cities, Mumbai and New Delhi. The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly attending Mood Indigo 2023, the annual cultural extravaganza hosted by IIT Bombay. The experience left me in awe! I was also the Contigent Leader of my college and also got a [certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMJChzaUcKUKqYJJW3EEGX2WogZyVPJh/view?usp=sharing).

I participated in the XIMUN 2023, the annual Model United Nations conference hosted by XIM University, with my go-to co-delegate, [Avinash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinashprasad-2001/). I am thrilled to have bagged the [Best Delegate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vTZl3K2kRTJgDgFr3lN5mxSaz7pnwvc2/view?usp=share_link) award at the conference. Our team represented Pakistan in the Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC). We decided to go with Pakistan because representing any other nation or a P5/ NATO nation is relatively more straightforward because there are lesser fingers pointed at you and Pakistan presented a unique challenge due to its reputation for alleged notorious activities. Overall, it was a satisfying victory, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have participated.

I am looking to to write blogs/papers on 'String Theory' in the near future. I have always been intrigued by the theory and couldn't get my head to wrap around it. However, now that my college years are coming to an end, I plan to dedicate my time to write about it. Another topic that I wanted to work on is 'Natural Language Models'. I intend to delve deeper into exploring on how exactly natural language models work, the neural networks behind it, some of the most popular models based on transformer architecture, like BERT, and GPT-3. You're always welcome to reach out to me if you want to collaborate on any of these topics.

I am modifying zuzu to port my [blog](https://anubhavp.dev/paperblog) (written in Hugo) to [zuzu](https://anubhavp.dev/zuzu). This entire site and the blog are now built using zuzu. Zuzu is a custom static site generator written in JavaScript. It includes static files compilation, dynamic search, and a rss feed generator. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu). Currently it is in a very early stage of development, and it is designed to work like a basic static site generator. But it can be modified to cater to your need easily.

March had mid-semester exams in stock for me. I thought I wouldn't pull through and fail miserably. (Chill. That didn't happen xD). But as I geared towards preparing for the exams, desperateley trying to collect notes, an immense sense of responsibility dawned upon me. [Smruti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smruti-dash-1210/) reminded me that we were supposed to build the half-baked project together that makes notes and academic materials accessible for free and I started on the first day of my exam and completed [Resoc](https://notes-sit.live/) on the last day of the exam. (Funny how I managed to find a way not to study enough xD). You can read more about it [here](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/resoc.html). We acquired a user base of 96 with an avg engagement time of 3m14s and more than 2980 reads within a week of launch! We are looking for active contributors interested in contributing their notes.

Dev:

- ~~[zuzu:](https://anubhavp.dev/zuzu)~~
  - ~~Implement feat. rss, search, toml config~~
  - ~~Improve templating~~
  - ~~Port '/blog' to zuzu~~
- ~~[Notes-SIT V2 of resoc with improved UI and features:](https://notes-sit.live/)~~
  - ~~Design and implement a better UI for the non-essential components, and implement a unifrom design lanaguage for the site~~
  - ~~Automate deployment using firebase and github~~
  - ~~Improve task management, and add chat features~~
  - ~~Collect and deploy notes~~
- [BitTorrent client]( https://github.com/fuzzymfx/bittorrent-client)
