### The ultimate Sisyphean high

Life in Jamshedpur was a time of absolute growth and transformation. I was in the sixth grade. We were used to this by now, the constant moving and rebuilding. The cycle of life, the journey of Sisyphus, was a part of our existence. Writing about Jamshedpur is a tough one. Jamshedpur was, is, the most amazing part of my life. Among all the Sisypheian journeys, this hill is where Sisyphus finally finds peace and a sense of belonging. The boulder feels like at rest before the Zeus of life inevitably rolls it back down.

Jamshedpur had everything to offer. Friends, improvement in my lady luck, and a sense of belonging. I was in the sixth grade. Movies made more sense, books, less so. The time to stop reading and getting lost was over. Teenage life had just begun. Adventures and mischief were the order of the day. I spent my adolescent years in this city, a place that was a mix of old-world charm and modern industry. The city was a beautiful blend of people from West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha, among others, all calling it home—primarily because it was situated so conveniently, sharing borders with all these states. We were in a new house, a new colony, and a new school. The house was weirdly architectured, but spacious, with a backyard that was attached to a small park. The colony was vibrant, and filled with families from different backgrounds. The kids were friendly, and I quickly made friends. The streets were lined with trees, and the air was refreshingly clean—punctuated by the hum of factories, a reminder of the steel plants that shaped its history. I found myself growing up, making friends, and building memories. *La vie en rose*.

I shifted to DAV again, in Jamshedpur. Initially, the transition was difficult. Jamshedpur's culture was distinct from anywhere I'd been before. Its kids had a more direct, sometimes abrasive way of bonding. They weren't outright bullies, but building rapport wasn't straightforward. They came from different, varied backgrounds than what I was used to seeing, and they were hilariously notorious. The teachers were strict, a mix of old and young. These kids used to have a ton of fun with the teachers, mostly involving name-calling, screaming, and shouting, and the teachers, in turn, went crazy. These kids groomed me well, and I quickly got ready for this battle, eager to be a member of this undisciplined colony. And so I did. I usually kept getting into trouble at school, fun trouble. An eleven-twelve-year-old is expected to be a little mischievous. Parents were worried, all parent-teacher meetings were a disaster for them. Academics were never an issue; I was always motivated enough to be in the top 10%. School was a lot of fun and I was involved in a lot of activities. My classmates remained the same across the years, from 6th to 10th grade, and we all grew up together. 

The colony was a big part of my life. Entirely different stories to tell, whole new universes that it led me into. Life in Jamshedpur had a lot of lemons to offer.

Nostalgia grips you like a rainy day, in Jamshedpur. Classrooms were dimly lit, the sound of raindrops tapping against the windows, the smell of wet earth wafting around, and the world outside would be a blur of grey and green. Returning wet from school and tuition classes, getting warmed up and sitting in front of the TV, watching the world go by. The rain would wash away the dust, grime and issues of the day, leaving everything fresh and new. My mind wandered, lost in thought, contemplating the world outside, a time of reflection lost in thought.

Jamshedpur wasn't far from Bhubaneswar, and we often visited our home, in our Hyundai. Car journeys now were longer, spanning seven to eight hours. The roads were wider, and the journey was more comfortable. We would stop at roadside dhabas for food, and I would often get lost in my thoughts, contemplating the world outside. The teenage me was more aware of the world, and I was starting to understand the complexities of life. Sisyphean journeys were now a part of my existence, and the teenage me was beginning to navigate the roads and remember the paths.

Life was not always pink. Writing about grief is difficult. The most heartbreaking event in my life has to be when I lost my grandfather in 2013. He was a kind and loving person, and his loss was devastating for me. So much so that I do not remember anything about the journey or the funeral. Everything felt cold. It was difficult living in reality, and the pain made me cry to sleep. Waking up again, back to the same unpleasant reality. That was my first encounter with grief. My process of dealing with grief, from what I learned, was to push it down deep. Now, looking back, I realize that processing grief is complex and multi-dimensional. I was too young to understand the complexities of life and death, and I didn't know how to process the loss. The entire journey back home was a blur. I don't remember the dates, the time or the thoughts that I had. The pain was too much for me initially. Getting together back at home, the process got easier. Staying with family and relatives, sharing stories, and looking at them going through the same emotional turmoil helped me cope. I was not alone. The realisation that you are not alone, and someone is there going through it all with you is a powerful coping mechanism. This hill was a tough one to scale. A lot more hills to scale, and a lot more lives to live, looking forward to meeting you in the next one, grandfather.

This one other time while returning back from home, I also got my first pet, Toffee. Reminiscing about Toffee feels surreal, as if we were siblings in another life, in a distant past. She was a beautiful Dalmatian—the sweetest, most obedient dog—with an infinite capacity for love that transcended space and time. My sister picked her up from our neighbours in Bhubaneswar while we were heading back to Jamshedpur; she was a gift from them. Initially, I was sceptical. I had never had pets and wasn't particularly too fond of animals. But during that eight-hour ride back to Jamshedpur, Toffee became an endless source of affection, quickly weaving herself into the fabric of our family.

The sad part of this story is that Toffee was taken away from us. My mother said it was too much for her to manage—a dog and two young children. Even now, I struggle to contemplate what was so impossible. She was such a sweet soul, potty trained and obedient. I remember the weekend we returned to Bhubaneswar to drop her off. My aunt was excited; she loved Toffee and wanted to keep her, which was the agreed-upon plan. The thirteen-year-old me was okay with this arrangement since Toffee would still be part of the family, and I would have brought her back after a couple of months. But, unbeknownst to us, my uncle and grandfather had hatched a different sinister plan. They gave her away when my aunt was not home.

Life moved on. Life in Jamshedpur was consuming enough, back then. The gravity of the separation hadn't hit me, yet. Now, years later, it feels completely devastating. I feel like something inside me broke that day, and I never fully recovered.

Missing Rio, and knowing how much he misses me, back at home, I could only begin to imagine the turmoil that two-three-month-old Toffee, who knew us as her only family after birth, must have gone through while separating. She loved us a lot, and this betrayal from her own family must have been devastating for her.

It is difficult for dogs to understand and process complex and cynical human emotions. Looking back, remembering her fondly makes it more and more evident of the void that she left in my heart, and how unfair life had been for her. From being in a loving family to living with the extended family to being given away, and for no absolute fault of her own. It makes more and more sense that we humans, don't deserve animals; pure unadulterated love, affection and loyalty. Our race, we are simply just not worthy of them. God must have made a mistake, creating such pure souls in a world so full of hate and deceit. Here, alone in New York, I think about her a lot; her indefinite showering of love and affection, and I know we'll be reunited in some form of life, next, for sure. Now that adulthood has set in, I recognize the emptiness her loss created within me. This encounter with grief was brief when I was a child, but having a new pet now brings everything back.

There's something magical about memories—how they weave time and space back together, how they linger in the corners of our minds, waiting to be revisited, shaping and defining us. I've come to understand that grief is not linear. Dealing with it is a continuous, non-linear, multi-dimensional process. It becomes increasingly more evident of certain repercussions of the past that I was never fully able to understand earlier. Now, twelve years later, my heart is processing the grief of losing Toffee and the void she left behind. It made sense why I am so attached to Rio and why the thought of losing him is so frightening. Her memories are etched in my mind. My sweet Toffee.

Certain incidents in life now make more sense, like the time I unexpectedly broke down in front of while my best friend was having a difficult conversation. He was breaking up with his girlfriend, and my job there was to console and support him. Between seeing him in pain, with red and wet eyes, there was something that triggered within me. I suddenly was overwhelmed and for the life of me, I could never fully process and understand why. Some friend crying in an unrelated situation seems like an abnormal absurd extrapolated emotional response. I was there to support him. Now that my internal strategy of dealing with grief is slowly becoming evident, I realize that I have a tendency to push down feelings, deep. The separation from redacted was not something that I had processed fully. Superficially, it had been dealt with - the passage of time, but the emotional scars were present. It wasn't until I saw them going through the same rite of passage that I had gone through, that I suddenly felt a familiar pang, and the floodgates opened.

It brings a sense of peace. It might seem unusually weak—a twenty-four-year-old man, strong enough to leave behind his high-paying job for the current market, friends and entire family and start life from scratch in perhaps the world's most costliest city, New York, with a loan of over a hundred thousand, suddenly breaking down in front of his friends and then choosing to write about it. But this vulnerability feels healing. This is what it looks like from within. 

While the revelations are peaceful, it is not easy to embrace them. The journey of life, a Sisyphean one, is a constant struggle against the weight of our own existence, a battle against the forces that seek to keep us down. But perhaps that is the point. Perhaps it is in the struggle itself that we find meaning, in the act of pushing the boulder up the hill, that we discover who we are and what we are capable of. Writing, looking at the sailboats in Hudson from my window under the sunny deep blue sky, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, I find solace in the knowledge that I am not alone in this struggle. Perhaps, thirty years from now, I will look back at this moment and see it as a turning point in my life, a moment of clarity and understanding, while on a sailboat in some distant land, fantasy or not. The sky would be blue though, always blue and not red. Blue territory is mine.

<!-- UPDATE THIS -->

Grounding back to Jamshedpur, I was now in the ninth grade, in 2014. The Sisyphean journey continued. The academics were getting tougher, and the pressure was mounting. Technical challenges were not what I was worried about. I was a really good student, math, science and literature (as you might have guessed) were my strong suits. Civics and history, not so much. Decisions about our future loomed large, and the pressure to perform well in exams was overwhelming. Ninth and tenth grades were crucial, and the pressure to excel was palpable. Life in school was a breeze. It was always filled with ups and downs, mostly harmless. Occasional reprimanding and small punishments are what made school more memorable.

*To be continued...*

<!-- The issue was not the pressure from the school or the teachers but from my parents. They were ridiculously invested in my education, constantly pushing me to do well, to score high marks, and to secure a place in a good college. This is where it starts to get dark for me. From the beginning, I was always coerced, and forced into education. While I understand the motivation behind it, I feel that this is what messed me up. The constant "Why can't you be like your cousin/ friend?" or "Why not 25/25, why 22/25" was a constant reminder of my inadequacies. Probably also how my anxiety started. I was never good enough, and I was constantly reminded of it. It never mattered, how hard I tried, all that mattered was in the end, it was not a 100/100. This issue doesn't stem here. It stems from a larger insecurity of my parents, primarily my mother who led me into school plays when I was a kid and then later always asking me to be better like my cousins who were always better than me because they went to a boarding school, woke up at 4 AM and god knows what else. At twenty-five, I am well equipped enough to understand how I would have dealt with this differently. I should have been left alone to be a child, to fail and succeed on my own merit.  -->

<!-- The year was 2016 now. The passage of time was becoming more evident. The world was changing. I could see the boulder ready to be rolled back in a year after my tenth grade was over. No matter how hard I try, Father would make us move again. My parents decided that it'd be best to move to Hyderabad, a city that was known for its educational background and opportunities for engineering. All of my issues in life have had to do with my parents coercing me to do things I never wanted to do. I didn't want to be the first in class, I didn't want to be the best student. I was happy with being an averagely good student who occasionally scored well enough to be in the top five. No amount of coercion or pressure helped, rather I grew more resentful of them. I was not ready to leave behind my friends, my life, and everything I had built over the years. The thought of starting over again was daunting, and this time I was unsure of what lay ahead. The decision was made, and the bags were packed once again. -->

<!-- Growing up feels a lot different. The world is a blur now, a constant rush of deadlines, meetings, and responsibilities. I see weeks and months passing by in a blink. Looking at the mirror, it feels like I am staring at a stranger. The facial structure seems familiar, but the eyes, seem different. They seem tired, weary, and lost, a distant echo of the child who once roamed the streets of Kolkata, played around in Asansol and explored the lanes of Jamshedpur with his best friends. 

The memories of the past are distant like echoes of a time before life sped up. Back then, the world seemed steady, but little did I know that soon, after moving countless boulders up various hills, I can't remember the last time I looked at an afternoon pass by.  -->

<!--Mortals, gods, and monsters alike are bound by the whims of fate; lives marked by joy and triumph, but also by tragedy and suffering. Each of us has our own personal myth that we live out every day—a story of love and loss, of hope and despair, a struggle against the unjust destiny we believe, and a prophecy to fulfill.


 Each time, I find myself answering the same question: what does this even achieve? It feels futile like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of building and rebuilding, always searching for something that remains just out of reach. But perhaps that is the point. After years of pushing the boulder up countless hills, I've come to realize that life isn't about reaching the summit. Like Sisyphus, perhaps the struggle itself is where we find meaning—an endless journey of rediscovery, with memories and experiences as the boulders we carry along the way. It is about taking the sourest lemons life has to offer and turning them into something resembling lemonade.

Only memories remain, and the journey is all that matters. After all, that's all we are, really, memories. And memories are all we leave behind. -->
