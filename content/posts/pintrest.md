Here's an interesting idea: try building Pintrest from scratch without doing any additional research. I'm going to try and do this in one sitting, just to test the current limits of my knowledge. The aim is to see how accurate my mental model of Pintrest is, and to visualize the gaps in my understanding. At the end, I'll do a quick review of the actual Pintrest architecture to see how close I got. Follow along if you're interested in system design and architecture!
