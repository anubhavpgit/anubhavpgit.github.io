This guide is specifically for the resume that I built for myself, for a SDE/SE role. These points may or may not cater to your needs, depending on the role you are applying for.

When I started building my resume, I thought of dividing into six sections:

- Introduction, links
- Education
- Experience
- Skills
- Projects
- Extra-curriculars

I started building my resume when I had just completed the second year of my undergraduate. After my summer vacations, with some minor experience in IOT, Cybersecurity, and Python, I started hunting for internships, and landed two-three of them. 

There are a couple of rules that I follow:

- Do not write complete sentences. Try to keep it short and account for more information about the matter. 
	
	Ex. "Worked on a project that involved the use of a Raspberry Pi and a camera module to detect the presence of a person in a room. The project was built using Python and OpenCV." can be written as "Built a person detection system using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module using Python and OpenCV."

- Avoid including **soft skills**, statements, intros, and conclusions. "An excellent team player", "A quick learner", "A good communicator", etc. 
are bogus. These are not skills, rather traits. Traits can be discussed on call or in interviews, while skills are what you have learned and can do to get shit done.

- Try not to **lie** in resume. Well, I did. Not completely, but I did. My advice to you would be not to lie, but if you want to follow what I did, here it goes:

  While building my resume, I decided to add three projects, out of which two I had completed, and one was half baked. I added all the information about all the projects completed. The trick was that the text I wrote indicated that the project is done and completed following best practices.

  All of them were ML projects. The third one was a prediction model. I was supposed to add an error correction algorithm; gradient descent, but I was feeling lazy and thought I'd do it later. Initially, I added that in my resume, but I finished what I started within a couple of weeks.

	Similarily, I never **officially** worked with TCS. I was working under a project manager/ developer as an intern. They did not give me any certificates, acknowledgement or anything. But, I still decided to pen down whatever I did accomplish in that short while. I was confident with the work I did, and with any questions thrown at me, I could answer them. This accountability is important.

	Do not try to fill up the page. If you have less experience, it's okay. You can always add more projects, or more information about the projects you have done. Do not bullshit your way through the resume. Adding more information about the projects you have done is better than adding more projects that you have not done. If you're adding something, make sure you have something to show and can account for it.

- Use a **single page** resume. If you have more experience, build a CV. A resume is a brief summary of your experience, while a CV is a detailed account of your experience. It is understandable if you have a lot to add, the challenge is to diiferntiate between what is important and what is not, what counts and what does not.

  The current generatation has extremely limited attention span, and they are not going to read through your resume. They are going to skim through it. Your job is to highlight the important points, and make sure they are visible. A single page resume looks neat and concise, and is easy to read.

- Do not include all of your educational qualifications. If you have a degree, you can skip the high school. If you have a post-graduation degree, you can skip the graduation. The latest degree matters. Rest are useless.

- Instead of hobbies, try to put down something that is more relevant to the job you are applying for. A football player is not going to be hired as a software developer. A keen eye for designs, a graphics desgin interest, or a  photography enthusiast can contribute well to front-end engineering.

- Try to add links for your projects that you build. Preferably deployed links, or GitHub repositories. 

The hirearchy of efficient content management in resume is as follows:

- Max span should be taken up by the expirence section, or projects if you do not have enough experience.
- The next would be projects.
- The next would be skills, followed by extra-curricular activities, and then education.
- Adding relevant liks such as LinkedIn, GitHub, or a personal website is a really good idea.


Here is my resume a couple of months later from when I started building it:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

</div>


Here is what it looks like [now](/resume.pdf)

To give you a little more insight, my current resume includes Bee, which I have not completed :P. The entire project mentioned goes like this:

	"A custom BitTorrent client to download movies with an item-based collaborative movie recommendation
		system based on user ratings and the no. of ratings & a movie rating prediction system to classify reviews with an 85% accuracy"

While the ML models for rating prediction and recommendation system are complete, the BitTorrent client is still in progress. I have completed a short version of the client, using the BitTorrent protocol, and the torrent library, but I wanted to write the entire client from scratch. I have not completed it yet, but I am working on it.

I would still not recommend following this.	

Hope this helps you build your resume. Resume building is an extremely subjective topic, and there is no right or wrong way to do it. The only thing that matters is that you are able to convey what you have done, and what you can do. Make sure you can highlight what you've done and it stands out.
