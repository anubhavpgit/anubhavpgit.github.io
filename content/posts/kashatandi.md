Hope is the most magical, marvelous thing. Hope keeps us alive.

<!-- Getting back up, slowly. -->

<!-- The attempt that worked; the attempt trying to scratch the surface of the walls, looking behind them, uncover the unsettling darkness that lies within. The walls we construct in our lives that we don't look behind. The walls that we build to protect ourselves from the world. -->
<!-- Building memories. After all, that's all we are, really. Memories. -->
