Life has been gradually improving for quite some time now, ushering in a serene calmness with each new day.

I now find joy in the simple pleasures; having a hearty breakfast, coaxing colleagues into joining me for fancy lunches, and persuading friends to hang out and spend an evening of fun before settling into bed, weary but fulfilled.

Putting down something close to my heart seems partly easier now. This transformation started when I decided to publish an article, "Life, the universe, and everything else". My last article shed light on how my life transitioned from one horrid experience to the other, how life kept pushing and pushing, each time scraping a piece of my elbow and knees, yet resilient enough to rise again, and ultimately how I learnt to slowly stand up. It provided me with a platform to engage with an audience. It's remarkable how much we can uncover about each other's inner worlds simply by communicating.

I used to think life was cruel. It punishes you and keeps pushing and pushing you until you fall on your feet and get hurt. In this tired, repetitive, unending world of meaningless infinite life loops, here are my two cents on the art of resilience — picking oneself up after a fall.

As attempting to stand back up, I grasp a few outstretched hands reaching towards me. Taking slow, hesitant steps, trembling feet, and grasping with anxiety, I reflect on the looming possibility of failure. Slowly starting to walk, looking up, realising that I can walk and am not alone. Others walk alongside — some ahead, some behind — each with their own stories and struggles.

Looking around, I see a few familiar faces looking back at me with their eyes glazed in anticipation. Some seek validation for their achievements, while others yearn for reassurance in their uncertainties. They acknowledge their missteps, their gaze carrying the weight of a million untold stories — apologetic yet determined to make amends. Walking beside me, expecting me to hold their hands and help them forward, mirroring the help I received. Some just wanted to talk, wanting me to be there and listen. Others, too tired to take the next step, wanted to change lanes and ask for help.

As we walk alongside each other, this eerie feeling of "this happened to me" surrounds us. We get lost in each other's stories. Visualising lives from another perspective helps us remarkably. Empathy reigns, and we look to live another day more resilient, looking forward to sharing our stories, breaking bread, and gulping with each other as we engross in laughter and mutual connection.

In a world teeming with activity, it's apparent that everyone, everywhere, is grappling with their own set of challenges. A million things are happening all over with a billion people. It seems that everybody everywhere is going through something. Life has ubiquitously become struggling. Some speak about the job market being messed up, some about the house prices soaring through the roofs of lighthouses, some about how finances are becoming more stressful, and some about how capitalism is at its peak: the rich get richer. 

Amidst the bustling cityscape, forging genuine connections feels like an insurmountable feat. Exploring what you are passionate about and an unwilling expenditure in a delusional "life" in the work-life balance are eating you up from the inside, and our mere existence is morbid. 

We grapple with our own internal demons, navigating the labyrinth of our minds where uncertainty reigns supreme. The challenge now becomes wrestling with the monsters that inhabit your grey space, and it is inevitable. Welcome to the daunting realm of adulthood!

<!-- The attempt that worked; the attempt trying to scratch the surface of the walls, looking behind them, uncover the unsettling darkness that lies within. The walls we construct in our lives that we don't look behind. The walls that we build to protect ourselves from the world. -->

We are all stuck here; we have problems. You might be on the further end of the scale than I am right now. But both of us are here. If I could walk downstairs, you could too. What you decide to make it is what ultimately defines you. In the end, it all becomes an act of letting go. Trying to get back up, holding hands and walking together. It took me some time to figure this out; you take the sourest lemon life has to offer and turn it into something resembling Lemonade. Share it among others; live, try, and help live. Build memories. After all, that's all we are, really. Memories.
