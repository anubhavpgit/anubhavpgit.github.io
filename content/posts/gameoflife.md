Cellular automata are computational systems used to model complex systems and nonlinear dynamics. They are made up of simple, identical units called cells that evolve in parallel at discrete time steps. The state of each cell is determined by the states of its neighbouring cells, and the cells update their states based on a set of rules. Cellular automata have been used to study a wide range of phenomena, including biological systems, physical processes, and social dynamics.

One of the most fascinating aspects of cellular automata is their ability to exhibit complex and unpredictable behaviour from simple rules. Conway's Game of Life is a simple cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

The main aim of the Game of Life is to simulate the evolution of cells on a grid through simple rules that mimic real-life population dynamics, leading to complex and often surprising behaviours. Specifically, the game explores how simple rules governing individual cells can lead to emergent complexity and patterns over time, including stable structures, oscillating patterns, and even patterns that exhibit motion.

A few rules govern the evolution of the game are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

    </span>
    <canvas id="lessthantwodead"  style="border: 1px solid black;"  >
    </canvas>
</div>


2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

 -->
    </span>
    <canvas id="twoorthreelive"  style="border: 1px solid black;"   >
    </canvas>
</div>

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

<div class="container" style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; text-align: center;">
    <canvas id="morethanthree"  style="border: 1px solid black;"    >
    </canvas>
    <span style="padding: 10px; color: black !important;">
 -->
    </span>
    <canvas id="morethanthreedead"  style="border: 1px solid black;"    >
    </canvas>
</div>

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

<div class="container" style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; text-align: center;">
    <canvas id="three"  style="border: 1px solid black;">
    </canvas>
    <span style="padding: 10px; color: black !important;">
 -->
    </span>
    <canvas id="threelive"  style="border: 1px solid black;">
    </canvas>
</div>
<br>

The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The game proceeds in discrete steps, with each step representing a generation of cells. At each step, the game applies the rules to each cell in the grid simultaneously, updating the grid to reflect the new state of each cell based on its current state and the states of its neighbours.

## The Game of Life in Action

</div>
<br>

**Generations**: <span id="generation">0</span>

To start, design your initial configuration by clicking on the cells to toggle their state. Once you're ready, click the "Start/Stop" button to watch the game evolve. You can pause the game at any time by clicking the "Stop" button, and clear the grid by clicking the "Clear" button.

The speed of the game can be adjusted by changing the `speed` slider. The game will evolve at a faster pace as the slider is moved to the right. The `grid` slider can be used to adjust the size of the grid, allowing for larger or smaller configurations.

The Game of Life serves as a fascinating model of how complexity can arise from simplicity, providing insight into topics such as self-organization, emergence, and cellular automata theory.


## A Turing Complete Machine

Formal languages and automata theory is a fundamental area of computer science that deals with abstract machines (automata) and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. It provides the theoretical underpinnings for designing compilers, and interpreters, and for understanding the limits of what computers can compute.

John Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating example of a cellular automaton, with infinite possibilities for configurations and patterns. It has been studied extensively by computer scientists, mathematicians, and physicists, and has been used to explore a wide range of topics, including complexity theory, artificial life, and emergent behaviour.

The Game of Life has been shown to be Turing complete, meaning it can simulate any computation that a Turing machine can perform, given the right initial conditions. This means it shares a theoretical connection with formal automata and can be thought of as a computational system. Research indicates that certain configurations in the Game of Life can be used to simulate logic gates, memory, and other components of a computer, demonstrating its computational universality and performing universal computation, making it a fascinating area of study for computer scientists and mathematicians alike.

### Building A CPU in the Game of Life

A CPU essentially is built up of three main components:
1. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
2. Memory
3. Control Unit

The **ALU** is the heart of the CPU, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations on data. It consists of a number of logic gates that can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. It's more complicated than that. 

<div class="container" style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; text-align: center;">
    <div style="margin: 10px;">
        <canvas id="alu-addition" style="border: 1px solid black;"></canvas>
        <div>Adder Circuit</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 10px;">
        <canvas id="alu-andgate" style="border: 1px solid black;"></canvas>
        <div>AND Gate</div>
    </div>
</div>

In addition, you can set up a glider collision that represents the addition of two binary values. A glider is a configuration of cells that moves diagonally across the grid, representing a "1". A "0" is represented by an empty cell.

Similarly, An AND gate can be created by positioning still-life patterns (static configurations that do not change) to manipulate gliders. If both inputs are "1" (represented by gliders arriving at the same time), they will interact to produce an output.

**Memory Unit** stores data and instructions that are currently being executed by the CPU. It consists of registers, cache, and main memory. The memory unit is responsible for storing and retrieving data from memory locations, and it plays a crucial role in the operation of the CPU.

<div class="container" style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; text-align: center;">
    <div style="margin: 10px;">
        <canvas id="memory-cell" style="border: 1px solid black;"></canvas>
        <div>Memory Cell(1 block)</div>
    </div>
</div>

Memory can be represented by stable patterns that remain constant unless disturbed by an external glider or oscillator. Stable patterns like blocks act as "bits" that can be toggled on or off by gliders, representing data storage.

The control unit manages the CPUâ€™s operations by directing data between the ALU, memory, and I/O devices. It fetches and decodes instructions, then signals the ALU and memory to execute.

<div class="container" style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; text-align: center;">
    <div style="margin: 10px;">
        <canvas id="control-unit" style="border: 1px solid black;"></canvas>
        <div>Control Unit</div>
    </div>
</div>

The control unit can be represented by glider guns that emit gliders at fixed intervals, simulating clock pulses. These pulses can control the timing of operations.

While it is theoretically possible to build a computer within the Game of Life, it is painstakingly complex but fun! It requires a deeper understanding of logic gates, instruction sets, implementing memory, and control units. The Game of Life serves as a fascinating model of how complexity can arise from simplicity, providing insight into topics such as self-organization, emergence, and cellular automata theory.

[Here's an actual CPU built in the Game of Life by Nicholas Carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2021/unlimited-register-machine-game-of-life.html). In this series of posts, he tries to explain how he built digital logic gates, multiplexers, and registers in the Game of Life. I would love to do this someday when NYU is not down my throat threatening to kick me out for not doing my assignments.

*If you choose carefully enough, you can make an entire computer inside the game, powered entirely by little things running around based only on those same simple rules of what lives and what dies in the next generation. An entire computer that could, in theory, perform any calculation that your computer could. It's an interesting mathematical diversion depicting Turing's completeness, the chaos that arises from simple rules, and it just looks pretty.*"
