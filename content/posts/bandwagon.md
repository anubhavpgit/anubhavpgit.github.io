AICTE(*All India Council for Technical Education*) states that approximately 1.5 million engineers graduate from India every year. Less than 3%, get into the creamy layer of tech jobs (*8–10+ LPA*), and the rest are left to fend for themselves.

The bandwagon effect is a psychological phenomenon in which people do something primarily because other people are doing it, regardless of their own beliefs, which they may ignore or override.

India is obsessed with Engineering, especially software engineering. India boasts of having the largest population of engineers globally. From a young age, Indian parents instill in their chil	dren the belief that a career in engineering is not just a choice but an expectation. This mindset is fuelled by a stream of success stories and testimonials from friends and family who have achieved prosperity. Indian parents primarily see two career choices: engineering and medicine. While medicine may offer prestige and social status, engineering, particularly in the lucrative field of software development, promises financial stability and career advancement. And I am not even touching the train-wrecking nerve that is IIT-JEE. That is a separate story for another day.

Following the fad, in my college, a staggering majority of students—more than 99.99%—enrolled not out of personal choice but because their parents deemed it so. Despite harboring interests elsewhere, they found themselves on a predetermined path, their aspirations overshadowed by familial pressures. Some of those who faltered in their pursuit of medical education often found themselves funneled into engineering as a fallback option. Whether by design or societal influence, students from every stream aspired towards a career in software.

Yet, beneath the surface of this collective pursuit lies a complex web of consequences. While the influx of engineers into the workforce may bolster India's economic growth, it also exacerbates issues such as **extreme unemployment**  and **intense competition**. With only a fraction of graduates securing coveted high-paying jobs, the majority, including you and I, are left grappling with uncertain futures and unmet expectations.

You, an engineering graduate, mugged up computer networks and operating systems, solved hundreds of Leetcode questions, and built a bunch of "Task management react applications," "Boston House price prediction," "Netflix Clone," and whatnot of projects, only to find yourself amidst a sea of fellow graduates, all striving for success and job satisfaction in the ever-competitive tech industry. Yet, it won't be long before you realize that this path paved with promises of prosperity does not align with your genuine aspirations.

You realize that this is not something you want to do with your life. Deep down, you yearn for something more that resonates with your passions and purpose. You realize that you've always wanted to teach. You've wanted to watch and review movies and make music. Maybe you wanted to travel, roam around, see places, or become a journalist, or a photographer. Or, maybe you wanted to pursue the bubble of fashion and entertainment, become a star, pursue film school; or maybe direct movies, sing or become a guitarist.

Now, faced with the realization that you've invested four years in a different educational field with an additional two to three years in discovering your true passions, you resolve to pursue higher education in your chosen field. You leave your job, engage in heated debates with friends and family, break your F.Ds, and embark on this adventurous journey of self-discovery, anxious and oblivious to what this path entails. Down the line, you figure out that now irrespective of whether you're successful or struggling, you're happy. You are content.

While I applaud your courage to rebuild yourself, it's hard to overlook that all of this turmoil could have been avoided if you had made educated career decisions based on your passions and aspirations rather than succumbing to societal pressure back in secondary school and high school.

Despite parental pressure, you could've chosen not to pursue engineering. Your decision could have made it easier for me to find a job. An average software company has limited jobs open. The current job market in the software industry is saturated, and the unemployment rate is drastically growing. Your decision not only could have helped you but also me and others get placed in a software company. Shielding us both from a situation like this; one pursuing a career apathetic, halfhearted, feeding and caring for the family, the other, interested in technology, wanting to build something, finding it hard to land a job in this unyielding market.

India's obsession with engineering, particularly software engineering, stems from a deeply ingrained societal mindset that equates success with technical prowess. While this fixation has propelled India to the forefront of the global tech industry, it's imperative to recognize the value of diverse talents and passions in shaping a more vibrant and inclusive society. It is essential to discover that true peace and contentment lie in excelling at the career which you're passionate about.

To those who find themselves at a similar crossroads, I offer this advice: dare to defy societal norms, heed the whispers of your heart, and embrace the journey of self-discovery with unwavering courage. For, it is only by following your true passions that you can truly find fulfillment and purpose in life.

Worry about excelling in your farmlands. Work harder to strive to be the best. Grow the sweetest potatoes out there. Polish and build yourself, for yourself, and only you are skilled enough to produce the sweetest potatoes in all the farmlands, in all the worlds.
