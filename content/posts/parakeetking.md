Life has been gradually improving for quite some time now, ushering in a subtle calmness every day. The days are still a blur of monotonous routines, the nights, a routine of napping and with nothing to-dos, but I find more at peace with the world.

I now find joy in the simple pleasures; having a hearty breakfast, coaxing colleagues into joining me for fancy lunches, and persuading friends to hang out and spend an evening of fun before settling into bed, weary but fulfilled. An evening stroll, working from the cafe, and attending stand-up shows before I go to bed are my daily routine now.

Putting down something close to my heart seems partly easier now. This transformation started when I decided to publish an article, "Life, the universe, and everything else". My last article shed light on how my life transitioned from one horrid experience to the other, how life kept pushing and pushing, each time scraping a piece of my elbow and knees, yet resilient enough to rise again, and ultimately how I learnt to slowly stand up. It provided me with a platform to engage with an audience. It's remarkable how much we can uncover about each other's inner worlds simply by communicating.

I used to think life was cruel. It punishes you and keeps pushing and pushing you until you fall on your feet and get hurt. I am equally an idiot as you are, with the same set of problems and issues hovering around my head. In this tired, repetitive, unending world of meaningless infinite life loops, here are my two cents on empathy and the art of resilience: something that worked for me.

As attempting to stand back up, I grasp a few outstretched hands reaching towards me. Taking slow, hesitant steps, trembling feet, and grasping with anxiety, I reflect on the looming possibility of failure. Slowly starting to walk, looking up, realising that I can walk and am not alone. Others walk alongside — some ahead, some behind — each with their own stories and struggles.

Looking around, I see a few familiar faces looking back at me with their eyes glazed in anticipation. Some seek validation for their achievements, while others yearn for reassurance in their uncertainties. They acknowledge their missteps, their gaze carrying the weight of a million untold stories — apologetic yet determined to make amends. Walking beside me, expecting me to hold their hands and help them forward, mirroring the help I received. Some just wanted to talk, wanting me to be there and listen. Others, too tired to take the next step, wanted to change lanes and ask for help.

In a world teeming with activity, it's apparent that everyone, everywhere, is grappling with their own set of challenges. A million things are happening all over with a billion people. It seems that everybody everywhere is going through something. Life has ubiquitously become struggling. Some speak about the job market being messed up, some about the house prices soaring through the roofs of lighthouses, some about how finances are becoming more stressful, and some about how capitalism is at its peak: the rich get richer.

Amidst the bustling cityscape, forging genuine connections feels like an insurmountable feat. Exploring what you are passionate about and an unwilling expenditure in a delusional "life" in the work-life balance are eating you up from the inside, and our mere existence is morbid. 

We grapple with our own internal demons, navigating the labyrinth of our minds where uncertainty reigns supreme. The challenge now becomes wrestling with the monsters that inhabit your grey space, and it is inevitable. Welcome to the daunting realm of adulthood!

As we walk alongside each other, this eerie feeling of "this happened to me" surrounds us. I realised that our lives were not a lot different from each other. All of us walking together are equally in debt, together, and may have separate issues, but we are there. Talking and sharing stories with each other helped me scratch the surface of the walls, looking behind them, uncovering the unsettling darkness within them. There are these walls we construct in our lives and not look behind. The walls that we build to protect ourselves from the world. 

Empathy proved to be a beacon of light that shattered this darkness. With a myriad of challenges weighing me down — financial issues, work-life balance, having to find new work, living alone, grappling with the increase in weight, being unable to make friends, breaking up, and what else not.

As I settled into a new workplace and gradually opened up to my coworkers, I realised that the trials I faced were not mine alone. Through heartfelt conversations, I discovered that others were navigating similar storms.

I made my friends read my article about all these issues I had been going through. They loved it and shared feedback. They rooted for me as if I were the main character of a movie. They wanted to help. They shared their stories.

Speaking to them helped me understand that it is okay and that it happens. One colleague confided in me about experiencing imposter syndrome, a sentiment I wrestled with. She said she also thinks she somehow got this job. Another friend said that he went through a similar breakup process. 

A friend said he had been looking to join a gym for a long time, while another wanted a badminton buddy, just like me. Some wanted to go on trips, and some wanted to hang out after the office, have a beer and talk about day-to-day life. I got to know that I am not the only one who is unsatisfied with his cook. I am not the only one who is looking for a better apartment. We chat about our short stories, lives, and places we come from. Talking about these million things started lifting me up. I didn't plan on doing that. It just happened.

These conversations transcended the mundane, offering glimpses into each other's lives, dreams, and struggles. As we shared our stories, I found solace that my experiences were not unique. We laughed, commiserated, and dreamed, finding comfort in our shared humanity. Visualising lives from another perspective helps us remarkably. Empathy reigns, and we look to live another day more resilient, looking forward to sharing our stories, breaking bread, and gulping beer cans with each other as we engross in laughter and mutual connection.

We are all stuck here; we have problems. You might be on the further end of the scale than I am right now. But both of us are here. If I could walk downstairs, you could too. Talk to people, share, watch movies, read stories, get lost in a million other worlds, and decide to do something about the issue. What you make it is what ultimately defines you. In the end, it all becomes an act of letting go. Trying to get back up, holding hands and walking together. It took me some time to figure this out; you take the sourest lemon life has to offer and turn it into something resembling Lemonade. Share it among others; live, try, and help live. Build memories. After all, that's all we are, really. Memories.
