Greek mythology is fascinating and full of stories that explore the human condition and the nature of existence. My fascination with it stems from the fact that even gods are flawed. They are not perfect beings, but rather, subject to the same emotions and desires as mortals— erratic, unpredictable, and often facing unintended consequences from their actions. Zeus, the king of the gods, is known for his infidelity and vengeful nature. Hera, his wife, embodies jealousy and vindictiveness, while Aphrodite, the goddess of love, is vain and manipulative.

Mortals, gods, and monsters alike are bound by the whims of fate; lives marked by joy and triumph, but also by tragedy and suffering. Each of us has our own personal myth that we live out every day, a story of love and loss, of hope and despair, a struggle against the unjust destiny, we believe, and a prophecy to fulfil. 

Sisyphus, the king of Ephyra, was punished by Zeus for cheating death twice. He was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, doomed to repeat this task for eternity, never able to complete it. I see the myth of Sisyphus as a metaphor for the futility of life and the eternal journey to find purpose in a world that is indifferent to our existence. A never-ending quest, a journey fraught with constant change and uncertainty.

My journey throughout these years feels quite similar. Not because I am being punished by Zeus for cheating death, not that I'd get caught, but because I find myself constantly building a new life in a new corner of the world, pushing a new boulder up a new hill.

Each journey represents a new beginning, a fresh start in a different city, where I find myself building a new life, making new friends, and indulging in new cultures. The ascent is filled with hope and possibility. Trying to find my place in the newfound world, building sandcastles, and relationships, and crafting memories. Eventually, the boulder rolls back down, signalling the inevitable need to move again, leaving behind what I've built and starting afresh. Empty houses - ones filled with laughter and joy, shops that let me pay later since I was a regular, now closed, replaced with malls and supermarkets, friends, now only in distant memories, neighbours who became family, and friends who became strangers. 

### Bhubaneswar: The Early Years

My earliest memories are rooted in Bhubaneswar. I must have been two or three at that time. I remember how my mother looked then. She had a white dress that I was very fond of. I have this strong memory of looking in the mirror while my mother used to comb her hair. It was a long, oval mirror. She used to take me with her everywhere she went. 

My father had a Suzuki Max 100. I must have been three or four and whenever we went out somewhere I always have had this inexplicable urge to sit on the fuel tank. It made me feel like I was the rider, the man in control. The lucid memories of faint incense sticks, the scenery, vivid imagery of lifetimes I lived, often heroes in those stories I heard from my grandparents, the snug bed I slept in nestled between my parents, and the blue tricycle I rode in feel like a different lifetime now — pieces of a world I left behind every time we moved. *Blue*, because I remember it was blue, and my cousin-sister had a red one, but she managed to break hers. Our mothers asked us to share the one I had. She had a knack for breaking most of her things. Chewed, scratched or demolished in forms beyond recognition. We were colour-coded. All my things, from my tiffin and a huge water bottle to my pencils, were blue. Hers were red.

We are six months apart, my cousin-sister and me. Every day, my mother would pick us up from school, and once we were home, she'd make us sit on the floor for lunch. For reasons I still don't fully understand, I always took an absurdly long time to finish my meal—it could stretch anywhere from one to three hours. The afternoon naps were floaty and euphoric, still lucid in my memory. They still transcend space and time. We had this incredible Sony music system, and we both had the same routine. The same music CD used to play every afternoon, and we were asleep by the end of the second song. That's why I could only remember the first two songs on the CD. *Ja re bhasi jaa*, and *Jajabara*.

The irony is that I only enjoyed the music then, but the song actually makes sense now. Quite similar to the myth of Sisyphus, a masterclass of a poem and epitome of Odia literature, [Jajabara](https://music.apple.com/us/album/jajabara-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-ep/1380220136) is a poem about a nomadic lifestyle, the poet describing his journey through the world, and the world being a stage. The poet refers to their mind as a wanderer- someone who constantly roams or seeks something beyond the immediate reality. It speaks about the poet's hopes or aspirations are limitless, indicating a deep longing or an unquenchable thirst for something greater, a cyclical nature of life where values or rules are constantly created and discarded, indicating the transient nature of human beliefs and the constant change in perspectives over time.

Those lazy afternoons of napping to music now feel like echoes of a time before life sped up. Back then, the world seemed steady, but little did I know that soon, after moving countless boulders up various hills, I can't remember the last time I looked at an afternoon pass by. The world is a blur now, a constant rush of deadlines, meetings, and responsibilities.

This was when my parents were starting a family, much like I find myself doing in a few years now. As I write this, my same sister got married last month, marking yet another cycle of life. In a year or two, her kids would be listening to Arijit Singh while taking a nap. It's strange how nostalgia grips you—reminding you that what once felt like yesterday is now a memory of a different lifetime, a distant past.

I do not remember a lot about the time there, for I was too young. Each time we packed up and left, I saw the boulder rolling back down. We started building a new life in a different city. The cycle of moving and rebuilding continued, each time leaving behind a piece of myself. 

### Tram Rides and Power Rangers

We moved to Kolkata in 2005; my father's job took us there. Leaving behind my grandparents was difficult. They told me stories and magical tales of morality and ethics. Each of my four grandparents, from both my mother's and father's side, had lived over half a century, carrying a treasure trove of experiences, perspectives, and memories that I loved to listen to.

Their stories weren't just simple fables but windows into worlds shaped by time and wisdom. My maternal grandfather worked in the Secretariat, while my paternal grandfather had been the Director of Education in Odisha. Both of my grandmothers were teachers, though my father's mother left her profession after marriage while my mother's mother continued teaching. They filled my head with wandering tales of the past, of a time when the world was simpler, and life moved at a slower pace. A time when the daily lunch process was to fish. My grandfather said he had to cross a river, daily, swimming to reach school, and mentioned how life has become easier for us- an obvious tale that the Gen Z have heard a lot, I'm sure.

In Kolkata, we lived in the company's quarters in Tollygunge, a small, close-knit space that quickly became home. The colony had just two modest buildings, side by side, separated by a narrow passage that led to a small backyard. At the end of this passage, tucked against the wall, was a bench where you could sit and feel the world slow down. One side was flanked by the buildings, the other by a tall barrier that seemed to enclose our little world.

We couldn't roam around on our bikes as freely as we used to; the streets of Kolkata felt too busy, too vast. Luckily, the main road I lived by had a tram stop near the mosque, and my memories of tram rides are still vivid. They were lovely. I remember how the ticket looked, the old paper with a red border, and the sounds of the bells; the bus conductor used to pull a rope tied to the roof, which was connected to a bell. Slowly settling into the busy, loud Kolkata life, the tram rides were a welcome respite, a chance to slow down and watch the world pass by.

A mosque was situated in the middle of the road. I used to figure out play time by listening to the *azaan*. Four-thirty in the afternoon was the time to go out and play. On the other side of the road was a sweet shop.

Kolkata was kind and homely. The streets buzzed with life, a symphony of clattering trams, honking taxis, and the vibrant hum of people filling every corner. The smells of street food mixed with the scent of incense from nearby temples, and the narrow lanes wound through neighbourhoods like veins through the heart of the city, each turn leading to a different world. It was a world much bigger than what we were used to. The transition was already difficult for us, Odiyas, as we did not understand Bengali, and Kolkata was adamant about making us learn it. 

We explored the city mostly by metro, and according to my mother, every trip to a station sparked an odd obsession in me—the escalators. I couldn't resist them. I'd race up and down the same one, completely captivated, much to my father's chagrin. In those days, corporal punishment was a common response to disobedience, and each time I ran wild on the escalator, and fell down and knew what awaited me next. Still, each time, I couldn't resist the pull of the moving stairs. I had to try and see if I could walk upstairs faster than the escalator moving down. I never could.  Now, I realise that like those metro-station escalators, I can never outrun destiny. It is to take you where you're supposed to go, no matter how hard you try, and it is for the better I believe, for life has a lot of lemons to offer, and I am yet to make a lot of lemonade.

My sister was born in 2005, and we spent the next year in Kolkata. I am unsure as to how I felt about her arrival. I was five and a half. With time, I remember the feeling of having to share my parents with her, which was new and strange. A new human being started taking away all my things, and I felt a bit annoyed at first. Siblings are territorial, and we were no different. We have some wild stories to tell. I pushed her so hard once that she had to get a stitch on her head. Now that I don't live with her, I miss her a lot, though I would never admit it to her. She is a lot like me, and I see a lot of myself in her.

During this time, *Manju*, our maid, used to take care of me. She, and her daughter, *Maampi* used to babysit me and my sister. She was kind and loving, often shielding me from my mother's scolding when I refused to study in the evenings. She even stood up for me when the colony kids bullied me. My mother had less mobility as she had to take care of my sister. While she couldn't take me everywhere like she used to, I used to roam around with my father. He bought me all sorts of things, and he still does. 

I believe my father, mother and I will always be together; in all worlds, and all variations of mortal and immortal universes. He would always be the father, and get me the things I wanted, on this earth, mostly tech gadgets and food. Maybe somewhere in a different timeline, in some galaxy far away, he might get me a meteorite, or perhaps a spaceship! He is overly sensitive and emotional and has a ton of wisdom to share.

I remember this one time I got lost in Victoria Memorial. My aunt was visiting us, and we went to the Victoria Memorial. I was holding his hand while gazing at the stars and walking straight. They seemed to follow me as if looking straight at me. I was fascinated by the stars, and I still am. They feel like a nomadic tribe, wandering the sky, telling stories of the past, much like *Jajabara*. Somewhere, Father left my hand and had to take out his purse. Oblivious, I kept walking straight, and when I turned back, I couldn't see him. I was lost and an extremely kind family offered me help and asked for my father's number. They even offered me ice cream, but I was too shaken to eat anything. 

Mother never let me go to Victoria Memorial again. I have the closest bond with my mother. I feel like she had always been my mother in all other worlds, loving, pushing me to get a 100/100 in exams for only God knows what reason, and constantly opposed to whatever I wanted to do for they might be too dangerous or too expensive or unholy of some sort, as if God is constantly waiting for me to eat that chicken on a Tuesday and punish me for it. However, when the time comes, it might be easier to convince her to ask to get that spaceship. Father might be hesitant, but she has a knack for getting things done from him. I could go on and on about my mother, and her love and reluctance to let me eat food outside of home and buy gadgets, but I will save that for another time. It would take aeons and still not be enough. 

The most memorable part of living in Kolkata would be the train journeys to and from Kolkata to Bhubaneswar. We often visited our home in Bhubaneswar, and I loved the train journeys at night. The train used to halt before entering West Bengal and my dad used to bring food from the *Kharagpur Station*. I feel that the journeys in my life have always made me feel better. They helped me live multiple lives, one in Kolkata, and the other in the places I used to visit. During the journey, we halted at various cities, with each having a different relative, friend, and a story to tell of its own. 

The train journeys were a time for introspection, a time to reflect on the past and plan for the future. The rhythmic sound of the train on the tracks was soothing, and the gentle rocking motion was comforting. They were a time to disconnect from the world and connect with myself, a time to dream, to imagine, and to create. Quite similar to the journey of life, pushing on boulders up multiple hills, watching them roll back, train journeys felt permanent; stopping at stations, and then moving on, pausing for a couple years, before hopping on another train, in another city, on another journey.

The boulder was yet to roll down, and a new hill was yet to be scaled. The memories of Kolkata are etched in my mind, a time of innocence and wonder, a time of exploration and discovery. 

### Growing Up

Asansol was an incredible place of growth and affection for me, largely due to the friends I made and the amazing experiences we shared. Somewhere in mid-2007, I found myself packed with bags, my mother and cousin uncles helping us move, yet again starting from the bottom of a different hill, a new boulder this time. 

My father was busy with tours. His job demanded a lot of tours. This eternal movement in my fate, my Sisyphean journey was because my father's job requiring us to constantly uproot and rebuild in different cities. Looking back, it was difficult, constantly moving and rebuilding lives in different cities, but these whims of fate have shaped our lives in ways we could never have imagined.

The company quarters we moved into were located in a sprawling colony and my house number was B2/2 (B2 was the building, and the apartment number was 2). The colony was huge, a little universe of its own, with its own customs. It was a mix of people from different backgrounds and cultures, mostly from Central East- West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Odisha: a mix of languages, traditions, and beliefs, a place where the world came together in a harmonious blend of diversity. We traded homemade dishes, celebrated festivals together, and played until the sun disappeared—or until our parents dragged us back home, whichever came first.

I was lucky enough to meet many kids around my age. Together, we formed a large, rambunctious group, though most of them were four or five years older than me. That age gap meant I often served as their errand boy, fetching items or doing other grunt work, but I was happy to be a part of the group. Two rival groups prevailed: the men vs the ladies. Each group had like four to five members, and we used to play hide-and-seek, football, badminton, and all sorts of games together. We went to tuitions together, watched TV, comics, went on long walks, shared game disks, and comic books, played IGI, and had fun! Vice City was big back then. The boys were more focused on comics, sports, and video games. We played badminton, football, and cricket, and usually, the cricket ball would end up in someone's house, and we would have to beg them to give it back. Evening 4:30 - 5 meant dashing out of the house, knocking, ringing doorbells, and bringing everyone out to play. Every day, without fail. 

On weekends, the colony would come alive with house parties—usually arranged by the girls in our group. All they needed was a little food, some snacks, and a place to sit, and they would plan a host of games I never quite understood. Birthdays were also a big deal; everyone would show up to celebrate, regardless of how well they knew the birthday kid. We played Badminton, and hide and seek a lot. These games were gender-neutral and thus played by everyone. The colony was a world of its own, a place where it’s hard to explain where all those hours went, and yet, each one left an indelible mark on my memory.

My family and relatives often used to visit us. In this new world, where the insides of this invisible boundary of the colony were my world, my family and relatives were always a joy to have. They brought with them stories, laughter, and love, filling our home with warmth and joy. Their arrival meant less studies, more roaming around, and some cash to spend when they left. My grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins were a constant presence in our lives, Now, years later, their memories make me want to leave New York and rush back home, giving me company when I am alone, making my subway rides a bit more bearable, and my nights a bit more peaceful.

Beyond the colony, there wasn’t much exploration of Asansol itself. Unlike Kolkata, we didn't go out much; the colony truly was my whole world. At eight, I was starting to understand that there was a larger, more complex society beyond our boundary walls, but the extent of my daily life revolved around my friends and our home. Here I am, a 24-year-old me trying to scour pennies and cents in this God-forsaken city to make ends meet, looking at days pass by, and nights go white with the snow and the world outside, a place where I am yet to find my place. 

My school was far away. I remember the bus rides taking one hour to reach the school. My school was like stepping onto a different dimension. It was a Christian Missionary School, deeply invested in sharing biblical stories and holding long, reflective assemblies. The institution’s strictness was jarring to me at first. It was also huge, boasting two expansive playgrounds and a canteen that sold mouthwatering spring rolls for just 10 rupees. I remember that I scored 100/100 in Math. I was always good at Math, Science, Grammar, Literature- you might have guessed so since I spent God knows how long writing this piece, and terrible at History, Civis, Hindi, and Arts. My parents put a lot of emphasis on scoring well. This somehow slowly started to shape my life in a way that I would not have actually wanted. I feel children should be left alone to be children, constantly failing, suceeding on their own merit- paving thier own way in the world, and not be burdened with the weight of the world. A lemon now I know how to make lemonade, for my child, when the time comes.

The vacation vacations were mostly spent back home. Asansol—and indeed most of West Bengal—came alive in October and November with Durga Puja festivities. Durga Puja has always been the most joyous time for me all these years. In all the cities I have lived, life has always been kinder to me in these few days. We would roam the streets at night, visiting brightly lit pandals and paying our respects to the idol of the goddess, returning just in time for community dinners at the colony tents. Novembers and Decembers, the winters were chilly and we couldn't sleep without a heater,, and that was also the year we bought our first car—a cherry-colored Hyundai Getz Prime. We often drove the 500 km to Bhubaneswar, weaving through scenic highways, pausing at roadside stalls, and listening to stories from my parents’ own childhoods, oblivious to what awaits when I grow up.

Looking back, I realize how simple everything was back then. The world felt small, and the days stretched endlessly. The transient inevitability of the non-linear passage of time was yet to dawn on me. I still don't truly believe in the concept of linear time. I don't feel Asansol was just two years of my life. It feels like a lot longer. Days were longer. Surrounded by family and relatives, life never felt lonely. My sister, who once fit snugly in my arms, is nineteen now. Back then, the world was a playground, and I was the undisputed king of the castle.

Yet, like every chapter before, the boulder couldn’t stay perched on that hill forever. This journey from one hill to another- the ultimate Sisyphean truth hurt this time. My friends in the colony were gradually being uprooted too—their parents worked in the same organization, which meant one by one, they all had to move on and I realised the inevitability of this journey. Again, back to square one, we were back with our bags packed. After five odd years of living in a different state, my father got a chance and thought it nice to go back to Odisha and live near home. Five years in a different state had raced by. It was time to start over, to push yet another boulder up another hill. But even though leaving Asansol stung, I found solace in the understanding that such is the nature of life: a Sisyphean cycle of endings and beginnings, each one layered with memories, friendships, and lessons I would carry forward.

### Back to roots

Yet again, I found myself in a new, unfamiliar world. I was nine years old now, in 2009, and my parents seemed happy. Moving to Jajpur, a small town in Odisha, meant we were closer to Bhubaneswar, making frequent visits to our extended family much easier. My grandparents were overjoyed; they could see us more often, visiting every weekend and sometimes staying with us for extended periods. This was a welcome change for all of us.

Our new move was peaceful and we gradually started settling down. I was in fourth grade now and used to attend the *Harrow Public School*. The school was small, with a playground that was more of a dust bowl. The school itself was housed in a large, unfinished two-story building. The first floor was divided into two sections: a vast hall accommodating four different classes without any partitions, and a smaller room designated for the primary grades—first, second, and third. 

I was introduced to my native, Odia language in a very raw form. The prayers, scripts and literature were a bit difficult for me to grasp since other students had been learning the language for a long time then. Despite this, the culture felt deeply personal and heartfelt. 

The exciting part was witnessing sixth and seventh-grade students getting disciplined by the teachers. Beating up students till they turned red was an essential discipline technique in a rural town. The teachers were strict, and the students were rowdy. The school was a mix of students from different backgrounds. Some were from the town, while others were from the nearby villages. I was excited to join the school since this school allowed students to use pens in the fourth grade and that is what mattered to me the most; pen users were the elite, and being able to scribble with a pen instead of a pencil was a significant rite of passage. 

Jajpur life was slow, peaceful, and simple. The town was small, with narrow lanes and small shops. The small town, with its narrow lanes and quaint shops, was enveloped by lush paddy fields. The air was rich with the scent of fresh earth and filled with the sound of birds. The evenings were cool, filled with the chorus of crickets, children playing, and the temple bells ringing. Nights were serene and quiet. The town was a world away from the hustle and bustle of the city, a place where time moved at its own pace. We rented a house and settled in, making it our home. The weekends were a ride to Bhubaneswar, and the weekdays were spent in school.

This new life also was my entrance into the world of music and rhythm. The house owner's daughter used to learn classical music, and both my parents, advent music lovers, wanted me to get into music, naturally. I was enrolled in *Tabla* classes and her tabla teacher was entrusted with teaching me Tabla. My mother had a fascination with the instrument. I was surprisingly really good at it. I was a natural, and I loved it.

Transitioning from a place where I had countless friends to a new home with hardly any children nearby was a strange and difficult adjustment. It was my first real encounter with loneliness. The few children who lived near us attended a different school—a more polished institution, perhaps, but one that seemed less focused on education. In the evenings, I spent most of my time alone, watching TV, playing on computers, or just wandering around the house. The loneliness was palpable, a constant companion that followed me everywhere. I missed Asansol, my friends, the laughter, the games, and the camaraderie. I missed the sense of belonging that comes with being part of a community.

My most favourite memory has to be the journey back to home. We would travel in our Hyundai Getz Prime, taking the four-hour drive to Bhubaneswar. The route was picturesque, winding through lush green fields, quaint villages, and increasingly wider roads as we crossed cities. The journey was a time to bond with my family, to talk about lives lived in the 70s, 80s and 90s, to laugh, and to share stories. A time to reflect and plan for the future, a time to dream, to imagine, and to create. The soundtrack to these memories was the Odia songs from the CD my father bought, featuring the soulful music of Akshaya Mohanty. I still remember the order of the songs and the lyrics, each one etching itself into my memory.

There is something profoundly liberating about being on the road, in motion, part of a journey. Much like my Sisyphean journey in life, roads are a metaphor for life, a journey fraught with constant change and uncertainty.

However, our time in Jajpur was brief. The rural setting, while peaceful, presented challenges for our family. Settling down proved difficult, and concerns about education and livelihood began to outweigh the town's tranquil allure. My parents decided it was best to move to Cuttack, as enrolling in a school in Bhubaneswar mid-year was impractical. The following year was thus spent in Cuttack, marking the beginning of yet another chapter in our ever-changing journey.

### Leaving back the rural life, moving to the city

Me, my mother and sister moved to Cuttack, while my father stayed back in Jajpur to wrap up his term, although the places weren't that far. The move to Cuttack put back a sense of belonging in my life. The city was vibrant, with a rich history and culture. The streets were lined with ancient temples, bustling markets, and the scent of fresh flowers. I was in fifth grade now, and I attended the *DAV Public School, CDA*.

Cuttack’s culture was as rich as its history. Because it’s one of Odisha’s oldest cities, it has welcomed people from all over India, creating a unique tapestry of communities. While Odia was the main language, I also encountered Bengali, Marwari, and other influences daily. The school introduced me to a bunch of new friends and perspectives, and mytuition classes were fun-filled.

Our life in Cuttack was beautiful, always filled with family and relatives, and more than half the time was back at home, in Bhubaneswar. I made a lot of friends, and living in a city made all sense to me. However, the boulder was yet to roll down, and a new hill was yet to be scaled. We were there for just another year before my father's office decided it was time. Time for another ascent, a boulder to be moved, a new life to be built. Bags packed, trucks loaded, sitting in a car, watching the city pass by, we found ourselves in Jamshedpur. The year was 2011, and I was in the sixth grade.

### The longest odyssey yet

Packed, yet again, I found myself in Jamshedpur. Life in Jamshedpur was a time of absolute growth and transformation. I was in the sixth grade. We were used to this by now, the constant moving and rebuilding. The cycle of life, the journey of Sisyphus, was a part of our existence. 

Jamshedpur had a lot, a lot of lemons to shower. I spent my adolescent years in Jamshedpur, a city that was a mix of old-world charm and modernity. The city was a melting pot of cultures, with people from West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha, among others, all calling it home. Primarily, because it was situated so conveniently, sharing a border with all these states. Life in this city was my magical world. I don't have to put enough emphasis on why a 16-year-old would find a city nostalgic, do the math, If you're here reading this, you have read enough literature. The streets were lined with trees, and the air was fresh and clean. The city was known for its steel plants, and the sound of the factories filled the air, a constant reminder of the city's industrial heritage. A place where I found myself growing up, making friends, and building memories.

It is difficult to think about what to include, and what not. Think about everything that goes on in the life of a school kid from class 6th to 10th. The first crush, the heartbreaks, fights, friendships, sleepovers, birthday parties, and what else not. I will let you be the judge of what to include from the diary of a school kid.

I shifted from DAV Sec-6, Cuttack to DAV, Bistupur, Jamshedpur. Transferring between DAVs isn't a hassle. Initially, the transition was difficult. Jamshedpur had a slightly rude, unwelcoming camaraderie. The school was a mix of all kinds of kids, mostly from Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. 

---

This one time while returning back from home, I also got my first pet, Toffee. Reminiscing about Toffee feels surreal, as if we were siblings in another life, in a distant past. She was a beautiful Dalmatian—the sweetest, most obedient dog—with an infinite capacity for love that transcended space and time. My sister picked her up from our neighbours in Bhubaneswar while we were heading back to Jamshedpur; she was a gift from them. Initially, I was sceptical. I had never had pets and wasn't particularly too fond of animals. But during that eight-hour ride back to Jamshedpur, Toffee became an endless source of affection, quickly weaving herself into the fabric of our family.

The sad part of this story is that Toffee was taken away from us. My mother said it was too much for her to manage—a dog and two young children. Even now, I struggle to contemplate what was so impossible. She was such a sweet soul, potty trained and obedient. I remember the weekend we returned to Bhubaneswar to drop her off. My aunt was excited; she loved Toffee and wanted to keep her, which was the agreed-upon plan. The thirteen-year-old me was okay with this arrangement since Toffee would still be part of the family, and I would have brought her back after a couple of months. But, unbeknownst to us, my uncle and grandfather had hatched a different sinister plan. They gave her away when my aunt was not home.

Life moved on. Life in Jamshedpur was consuming enough, back then. The gravity of the separation hadn't hit me, yet. Now, years later, it feels completely devastating. I feel like something inside me broke that day, and I never fully recovered.

Missing Rio, and knowing how much he misses me, back at home, I could only begin to imagine the turmoil that two-three-month-old Toffee, who knew us as her only family after birth, must have gone through while separating. She loved us a lot, and this betrayal from her own family must have been devastating for her.

It is difficult for dogs to understand and process complex and cynical human emotions. Looking back, remembering her fondly makes it more and more evident of the void that she left in my heart, and how unfair life had been for her. From being in a loving family to living with the extended family to being given away, and for no absolute fault of her own. It makes more and more sense that we humans, don't deserve animals; pure unadulterated love, affection and loyalty. Our race, we are simply just not worthy of them. God must have made a mistake, creating such pure souls in a world so full of hate and deceit. Here, alone in New York, I think about her a lot; her indefinite showering of love and affection, and I know we'll be reunited in some form of life, next, for sure. Now that adulthood has set in, I recognize the emptiness her loss created within me. This encounter with grief was brief when I was a child, but having a new pet now brings everything back.

There's something magical about memories—how they weave time and space back together, how they linger in the corners of our minds, waiting to be revisited, shaping and defining us. I've come to understand that grief is not linear. Dealing with it is a continuous, non-linear, multi-dimensional process. It becomes increasingly more evident of certain repercussions of the past that I was never fully able to understand earlier. Now, twelve years later, my heart is processing the grief of losing Toffee and the void she left behind. It made sense why I am so attached to Rio and why the thought of losing him is so frightening. Her memories are etched in my mind.

Certain incidents in life now make more sense, like the time I unexpectedly broke down in front of my best friend. He was breaking up with his girlfriend, and my job there was to console and support him. Between seeing him in pain, with red and wet eyes, there was something that triggered within me. I suddenly was overwhelmed and for the life of me, I could never fully process and understand why. While I was close to both of them and played a significant role in their relationship, my reaction seemed disproportionate. Now that my internal strategy of dealing with grief is slowly becoming evident, I realize that I have a tendency to push down feelings, deep. The separation from Khusi was not something that I had processed fully. It wasn't until I saw them going through the same rite of passage that I had gone through, that I suddenly felt a familiar pang, and the floodgates opened.

It brings a sense of peace. It might seem unusually weak—a twenty-four-year-old man, strong enough to leave behind his high-paying job for the current market, friends and entire family and start life from scratch in perhaps the world's most costliest city, New York, with a loan of over a hundred thousand, suddenly breaking down in front of his friends and then choosing to write about it. But this vulnerability feels healing. This is what it looks like from within.

<!-- Growing up feels a lot different. The world is a blur now, a constant rush of deadlines, meetings, and responsibilities. I see weeks and months passing by in a blink. Looking at the mirror, it feels like I am staring at a stranger. The facial structure seems familiar, but the eyes, seem different. They seem tired, weary, and lost, a distant echo of the child who once roamed the streets of Kolkata, played around in Asansol and explored the lanes of Jamshedpur with his best friends. 

The memories of the past are distant like echoes of a time before life sped up. Back then, the world seemed steady, but little did I know that soon, after moving countless boulders up various hills, I can't remember the last time I looked at an afternoon pass by.  -->

<!-- Each time, I find myself answering the same question: what does this even achieve? It feels futile like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of building and rebuilding, always searching for something that remains just out of reach. But perhaps that is the point. After years of pushing the boulder up countless hills, I've come to realize that life isn't about reaching the summit. Like Sisyphus, perhaps the struggle itself is where we find meaning—an endless journey of rediscovery, with memories and experiences as the boulders we carry along the way. It is about taking the sourest lemons life has to offer and turning them into something resembling lemonade.

Only memories remain, and the journey is all that matters. After all, that's all we are, really, memories. And memories are all we leave behind. -->
