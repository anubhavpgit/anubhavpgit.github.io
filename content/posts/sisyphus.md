Greek mythology is fascinating, full of stories that explore the human condition and the nature of existence. My fascination with it stems from the fact that even gods are flawed. They are not perfect beings, but rather, subject to the same emotions and desires as mortals—capricious, unpredictable, and often facing unintended consequences from their actions. Zeus, the king of the gods, is known for his infidelity and vengeful nature. Hera, his wife, embodies jealousy and vindictiveness, while Aphrodite, the goddess of love, is vain and manipulative.

Mortals, gods, and monsters alike are bound by the whims of fate. Our lives are marked by joy and triumph, but also by tragedy and suffering. Each of us has our own personal myth that we live out every day, a prophecy to fulfil.

Sisyphus, the king of Ephyra, was punished by the gods for his deceitfulness in cheating death twice. He was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down. He was doomed to repeat this task for eternity, never able to complete it. I see the myth of Sisyphus as a metaphor for the futility of life and the eternal struggle to find meaning in a world that is indifferent to our existence. Finding purpose in life is a never-ending quest, a journey that is fraught with uncertainty and doubt.

My journey throughout these twenty-four years has been quite similar. Not because I am being punished by the gods for cheating death, but because I find myself constantly building a new life in a new corner of the world, pushing a new boulder up a different hill, only to watch it roll back down again. Each push represents a new beginning, a fresh start in a different city, where I find myself building a new life, making new friends, and immersing in a new culture. The ascent is filled with hope and possibility. Still, eventually, the boulder rolls back down, signalling the inevitable need to move again, leaving behind what I've built and starting afresh.

My earliest memories are of Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. I remember how my mother looked. She had a white saree that I was very fond of. My mother said that we had moved to a different house for a while, for our house was getting renovated. I remember the house we rented, in Shastri Nagar. There was a haunted house nearby. The faint incense sticks still feel like yesterday. The mirror my mother used to comb her hair, the snug bed I slept in between my parents, and the *blue* tricycle I rode in are all fond memories. *Blue*, because I remember it was blue, and my sister had a red one, but she broke her's and we used to share the one. We were colour-coded. All my things from my tiffin and a huge water bottle to my pencil-box and backpacks were blue. Her was red.

We moved back to our house in two years. My mother used to pick me and my sister up from school, and after coming back, she used to make us sit on the ground and eat lunch. For some unknown reason, I used to take a really, really long time for lunch. It used to range from one to three hours. The afternoon naps were floaty and euphoric, still lucid in my memory. I used to transcend space and time. We both had a routine. The same music CD used to play every afternoon, and we were asleep by the end of the second song. That's why I only remember the first two songs on the CD. *Ja re bhasi jaa*, and *Jajabara*. We had this amazing Sony music system.

The irony is, that it makes more and more sense as I grow up. I don't know why I loved that song when I was three. I get what *Jajabara ( 1975 )* is all about. A masterclass of a poem and epitome of Odia literature, [Jajabara](https://music.apple.com/us/album/jajabara-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-ep/1380220136) is a poem about a nomadic lifestyle, author describing his journey through the world, and the world being a stage. The poet refers to their mind as a wanderer, someone who constantly roams or seeks something beyond the immediate reality. It suggests a restless or adventurous spirit. It speaks about the poet's hopes or aspirations are limitless, indicating a deep longing or an unquenchable thirst for something greater. It suggests a cyclical nature of life where values or rules are constantly created and discarded, indicating the transient nature of human beliefs and the constant change in perspectives over time. The exillence is in how after 50 years, the song makes more sense than ever. It uses the image of a sandcastle to represent dreams or aspirations, which are beautiful yet fragile and temporary, easily washed away by the tides of reality.

This was in 2002-2003, a time when my father got married and started his family, much like I find myself doing in a few years now. Another boulder up a different hill. As I write this, my same sister is preparing for her wedding next month, marking yet another cycle of life. In a year or two, her kids would be listening to Arijit Singh while taking a nap. A fresh start with a new boulder. A cycle completed. It's strange how nostalgia grips you—reminding you that what once felt like yesterday is now a memory of a distant past.

We moved to Kolkata in 2004. My father's job took us there. We had gotten quarters in the company's colony. The colony, in Tallygunge, was a small one, it had two buildings one beside the other, a narrow entrance and common passage for both, and a small backyard. Towards the end the turning for the backyard used to be a bench. One side was buildings, and the other side was a tall wall. This was situated on the main road, and a mosque was in the middle of the road. I used to figure out time by listening to the *azaan*. On the other side of the road was a sweet shop.

Each time, I find myself answering the same question: what does this even achieve? It feels futile, like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of building and rebuilding, always searching for something that remains just out of reach. But perhaps that is the point. Life is not about reaching a destination, but rather, about the journey itself. It is about taking the sourest lemons life has to offer and turning it into something resembling lemonade.

Only memories remain, and the journey is all that matters. After all, that's all we are, really, memories. And memories are all we leave behind.
