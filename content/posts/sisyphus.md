Greek mythology is fascinating, full of stories that explore the human condition and the nature of existence. My fascination with it stems from the fact that even gods are flawed. They are not perfect beings, but rather, subject to the same emotions and desires as mortals—capricious, unpredictable, and often facing unintended consequences from their actions. Zeus, the king of the gods, is known for his infidelity and vengeful nature. Hera, his wife, embodies jealousy and vindictiveness, while Aphrodite, the goddess of love, is vain and manipulative.

Mortals, gods, and monsters alike are bound by the whims of fate; lives marked by joy and triumph, but also by tragedy and suffering. Each of us has our own personal myth that we live out every day, a prophecy to fulfil. 

Sisyphus, the king of Ephyra, was punished by Zeus for cheating death twice. He was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, doomed to repeat this task for eternity, never able to complete it. I see the myth of Sisyphus as a metaphor for the futility of life and the eternal journey to find purpose in a world that is indifferent to our existence. A never-ending quest, a journey fraught with constant change and uncertainty.

My journey throughout these years has been quite similar. Not because I am being punished by Zeus for cheating death, but because I find myself constantly building a new life in a new corner of the world, pushing a new boulder up a different hill.

Each journey represents a new beginning, a fresh start in a different city, where I find myself building a new life, making new friends, and indulging in new cultures. The ascent is filled with hope and possibility. Trying to find my place in the newfound world, building relationships, and creating memories. Eventually, the boulder rolls back down, signalling the inevitable need to move again, leaving behind what I've built and starting afresh. Empty houses - ones filled with laughter and joy, shops that let me pay later since I was a regular, now closed, neighbours who became family, and friends who became strangers. 

My earliest memories are of Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. I was two or three, maybe. I remember how my mother looked then. She had a white dress that I was very fond of. I remember looking at the mirror my mother used to comb her hair in. It was a small, round mirror with a wooden frame. She used to take me with her everywhere. My father had a Suzuki Max 100. I had this unexplainable desire to sit on the fuel tank. It made me feel like I was the rider and in control of the bike. The lucid memories of faint incense sticks, the snug bed I slept in between my parents, and the blue tricycle I rode in feel like a different lifetime now — pieces of a world I left behind every time we moved. *Blue*, because I remember it was blue, and my cousin-sister had a red one, but she managed to break hers. Our mothers asked us to share the one I had. She broke most of her things. Chewed or demolished in forms not recognizable. We were colour-coded. All my things, from my tiffin and a huge water bottle to my pencil boxes, were blue. Hers were red.

We are six months apart, my cousin-sister and me. My mother used to pick me and my sister up from school, and after returning home, she used to make us sit on the ground and eat lunch. For some unknown reason, I used to take a really, really long time to eat. It used to range from one to three hours. The afternoon naps were floaty and euphoric, still lucid in my memory. They still help me transcend space and time. We had this amazing Sony music system, and we both had a routine. The same music CD used to play every afternoon, and we were asleep by the end of the second song. That's why I could only remember the first two songs on the CD. *Ja re bhasi jaa*, and *Jajabara*.

The irony of listening to that song is that it always made more and more sense as I grew up, and the less I heard growing up. A masterclass of a poem and epitome of Odia literature, [Jajabara](https://music.apple.com/us/album/jajabara-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-ep/1380220136) is a poem about a nomadic lifestyle, author describing his journey through the world, and the world being a stage. The poet refers to their mind as a wanderer- someone who constantly roams or seeks something beyond the immediate reality. It speaks about the poet's hopes or aspirations are limitless, indicating a deep longing or an unquenchable thirst for something greater, a cyclical nature of life where values or rules are constantly created and discarded, indicating the transient nature of human beliefs and the constant change in perspectives over time. It uses vivid imagery of a sandcastle to represent dreams or aspirations, which are beautiful yet fragile and temporary, easily washed away by the tides of reality.

Those lazy afternoons of napping to music now feel like echoes of a time before life sped up. Back then, the world seemed steady, but little did I know that soon, after moving up countless boulders up various hills, I can't remember the last time I looked at an afternoon pass by. The world is a blur now, a constant rush of deadlines, meetings, and responsibilities.

This was in 2000-2003— a time when my father got married and started his family, much like I find myself doing in a few years now. As I write this, my same sister is preparing for her wedding next month, marking yet another cycle of life. In a year or two, her kids would be listening to Arijit Singh while taking a nap. It's strange how nostalgia grips you—reminding you that what once felt like yesterday is now a memory of a distant past.

But each time we packed up and left, I saw the boulder rolling back down. We started building a new life in a different city.

We moved to Kolkata in 2004. My father's job took us there. Leaving behind my grandparents was difficult. They told me stories and magical tales of morality and ethics. We had gotten quarters in the company's colony. The colony in Tallygunge was small; it had two buildings, one beside the other, a narrow entrance and a passage for both, and a small backyard. Towards the end, attached to the wall was a bench. The passage then streamlined into the backyard there. On one side were buildings, and on the other was a tall barrier. The watchman's name was Biswanath. I absolutely loved his room. He had a tiny matchbox room below the stairs and had a small radio that operated well. He used to sit there and listen to the radio. I used to sit beside him and watch the road. 

We couldn't roam around on our bikes like we used to, like in Bhubaneswar. Luckily, the main road I lived by had a tram stop near the mosque. My memories of tram rides are still intact. They were lovely. I remember how the ticket looked. I remember the sounds of the bells; the bus conductor used to pull a rope tied to the roof, which was connected to a bell. This was situated on the main road, and a mosque was in the middle of the road. I used to figure out time by listening to the *azaan*. On the other side of the road was a sweet shop. Kolkata was a big city to us. The transition was already difficult for us, Odiyas, as we did not understand Bengali, and Kolkata was adamant about making us learn it. 

Kolkata was kind and homely. The city was loud, and the people were louder. The city was a cacophony of sounds, smells, and sights. The city was a maze of narrow lanes and bylanes, each leading to a different world. My sister was born in 2005, and we spent the next two years in Kolkata. Our maid, *Manju* used to take care of us. She was a kind, loving woman. She used to fight for me with the colony kids who used to bully me.

Looking back, I realize how simple everything was back then. The world was small, and the days were long. The transient inevitability of the non-linear passage of time was yet to dawn on me. Days were longer. Surrounded by family and relatives, life never felt lonely. My sister who was the size of my arm then is 19 now. The world was a playground, and I was the king of the castle. I had a Nintendo and watched Power Rangers, Doraemon, and other cartoons. We used to rent VCDs from the local store. I was pretty excited about *Dhoom 2*, while my mother wanted to watch *Veer Zara*, and one disk used to contain three movies. 


The most memorable part of living in Kolkata would be the train journeys to and from Kolkata. We visited our home in Bhubaneswar often, and I loved the train journeys at night. The train used to halt before entering West Bengal and my dad used to bring food from the *Kharagpur Station*. I feel that the journeys in my life have always made me feel better. They helped me live mulitple lives, one in Kolkata, and the other in the places I used to visit. 

The train journeys were a time for introspection, a time to reflect on the past and plan for the future. The rhythmic sound of the train on the tracks was soothing, and the gentle rocking motion of the train was comforting. The train journeys were a time to disconnect from the world and connect with myself. They were a time to dream, to imagine, and to create. Quite similar to the journey of life, pushing on boulders up multiple hills, watching them roll back, trains stopping at stations, and then moving on, pausing for a moment before hopping on another train, in another city, on another journey.

The boulder was yet to roll down. 

In 2007, I found myself packed with bags, my mother and distant cousin uncles, in Asansol, yet again starting from the bottom of a different hill, a new boulder this time. My father was busy with tours. His job demanded a lot of tours. 

This eternal movement my fate, my Sisyphean journey is due to the fact that my father's job required him to move every two and a half years. It was disheartening, the constant moving and rebuilding.

<!-- Each time, I find myself answering the same question: what does this even achieve? It feels futile, like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of building and rebuilding, always searching for something that remains just out of reach. But perhaps that is the point. After years of pushing the boulder up countless hills, I've come to realize that life isn't about reaching the summit. Like Sisyphus, perhaps the struggle itself is where we find meaning—an endless journey of rediscovery, with memories and experiences as the boulders we carry along the way. It is about taking the sourest lemons life has to offer and turning it into something resembling lemonade.

Only memories remain, and the journey is all that matters. After all, that's all we are, really, memories. And memories are all we leave behind. -->
