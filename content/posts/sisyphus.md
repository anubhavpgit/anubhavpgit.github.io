Greek mythology is full of stories that explore the human condition and the nature of existence. My fascination with Greek Mythology is about how even Gods can be flawed. They are not perfect beings, but rather, they are subject to the same emotions and desires as mortals. They are capricious and unpredictable, and their actions often have unintended consequences. Zeus, the king of the gods, is known for his infidelity and his vengeful nature. Hera, his wife, is jealous and vindictive. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, is vain and manipulative.

Mortals, gods, and monsters are all subject to the whims of fate. Our lives are often marked by joy and triumph, but also by tragedy and suffering. Each of us have our own personal myth that we live out every day, and a prophecy that we must fulfil.

Sisyphus, the king of Ephyra, was punished by the gods for his deceitfulness for cheating death and was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down. He was doomed to repeat this task for eternity, never able to complete it. The myth of Sisyphus is a metaphor for the futility of life, and the eternal struggle to find meaning in a world that is indifferent to our existence.

I find my journey quite similar to that of Sisyphus. Not because I am being punished by the gods, but because I find myself constantly building a new life in a new corner of the world. 

Life has been rather kind to me these past twenty-four years. I have had the privilege of living in different cities, now countires, meeting new people, and experiencing new cultures.

But with every new beginning, there is also an ending. Every time I move to a new place, I leave behind a part of myself. I leave behind friends and family, memories and experiences. I leave behind a life that I have built for myself, only to start again from scratch.

There are still a ton of boulders to let go rolling down the hill, a ton to carry up the hill. I don't think I am stopping anytime soon. With every boulder I have pushed, I feel a little closer to figuring out the meaning of this futile existence.

2025 is me, sitting back and enjoying the view. I am going to take a step back, take a deep breath, and appreciate all that I have accomplished so far. Looking back at all the places I have been to, all the people I have met, all the experiences I have had, all the boulders I have pushed up the hill.

I am going to let go of the boulder in NYC and see where it takes me this time.
