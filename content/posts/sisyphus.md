Greek mythology is fascinating, full of stories that explore the human condition and the nature of existence. My fascination with it stems from the fact that even gods are flawed. They are not perfect beings, but rather, subject to the same emotions and desires as mortals—capricious, unpredictable, and often facing unintended consequences from their actions. Zeus, the king of the gods, is known for his infidelity and vengeful nature. Hera, his wife, embodies jealousy and vindictiveness, while Aphrodite, the goddess of love, is vain and manipulative.

Mortals, gods, and monsters alike are bound by the whims of fate; lives marked by joy and triumph, but also by tragedy and suffering. Each of us has our own personal myth that we live out every day, a prophecy to fulfil. 

Sisyphus, a cunning king of Ephyra, was punished by the gods for his deceitfulness in cheating death, twice. He was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down. He was doomed to repeat this task for eternity, never able to complete it. I see the myth of Sisyphus as a metaphor for the futility of life and the eternal journey to find purpose in a world that is indifferent to our existence. A never-ending quest, a journey fraught with constant change and uncertainty.

My journey throughout these years has been quite similar. Not because I am being punished by the Zeus for cheating death, but because I find myself constantly building a new life in a new corner of the world, pushing a new boulder up a different hill.

Each push represents a new beginning, a fresh start in a different city, where I find myself building a new life, making new friends, and immersing in a new culture. The ascent is filled with hope and possibility. Different cultures, different languages, different journeys each time, trying to find my place in the newfound world, building relationships, and creating memories. Eventually, the boulder rolls back down, signalling the inevitable need to move again, leaving behind what I've built and starting afresh. Empty houses, ones filled with laughter and joy, shops that let me pay later since I was a regular, now closed, neighbours who became family, and friends who became strangers. 

My earliest memories are of Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. I was two, or three maybe. I remember how my mother looked then. She had a white dress that I was very fond of. I remember looking at the mirror my mother used to comb her hair in. It was a small, round mirror, with a wooden frame. She used to take me with her everywhere. My father had a Suzuki Max 100. I had this unexplainable desire of sitting on the fuel tank, made me feel like I was the rider. The lucid memories of faint incense sticks, the snug bed I slept in between my parents, and the blue tricycle I rode in feel like a different lifetime now—pieces of a world I left behind every time we moved, as though the boulder of change kept erasing the past. *Blue*, because I remember it was blue, and my sister had a red one, but she broke her's and we used to share the one I had. She broke most of her things. Chewed or demolished in forms not recognizable. We were colour-coded. All my things from my tiffin and a huge water bottle to my pencil-box and backpacks were blue. Her was red.

Looking back, how simple everything was back then. The world was small, and the days were long. The transient inevitability of change was yet to dawn on me. Surrounded by family, and relatives, life never felt lonely. The world was a playground, and I was the king of the castle. The boulder of change was yet to roll down the hill.

We are six months apart, my cousin sister and me. My mother used to pick me and my sister up from school, and after coming back, she used to make us sit on the ground and eat lunch. For some unknown reason, I used to take a really, really long time for eating. It used to range from one to three hours. The afternoon naps were floaty and euphoric, still lucid in my memory. Afternoon naps still help me transcend space and time. There is a weird energy in afternoon naps. The sky felt less blue, and more red and violet. We had this amazing Sony music system, and we both had a routine. The same music CD used to play every afternoon, and we were asleep by the end of the second song. That's why I only remember the first two songs on the CD. *Ja re bhasi jaa*, and *Jajabara*.

The irony is, the music always made more and more sense as I grew up. A masterclass of a poem and epitome of Odia literature, [Jajabara](https://music.apple.com/us/album/jajabara-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-ep/1380220136) is a poem about a nomadic lifestyle, author describing his journey through the world, and the world being a stage. The poet refers to their mind as a wanderer, someone who constantly roams or seeks something beyond the immediate reality. It speaks about the poet's hopes or aspirations are limitless, indicating a deep longing or an unquenchable thirst for something greater, a cyclical nature of life where values or rules are constantly created and discarded, indicating the transient nature of human beliefs and the constant change in perspectives over time. It uses vivid imagery of a sandcastle to represent dreams or aspirations, which are beautiful yet fragile and temporary, easily washed away by the tides of reality.

The sisyphean task of building a sandcastle, only to watch it be washed away by the waves, is a metaphor for the futility of human existence. The poet's journey through life feels personal, marked by constant change and uncertainty, a never-ending cycle of creation and destruction. The world is a stage, and we are merely actors, playing our parts before the curtain falls.

Those lazy afternoons of napping to music now feel like echoes of a time before life sped up. Back then, the world seemed steady, but little did I know that soon, after moving up countless boulders up various hills, I can't remember the last time I looked at an afternoon pass by. The world is a blur now, a constant rush of deadlines, meetings, and responsibilities. The boulder of change keeps rolling, and I keep pushing, hoping to find a moment of stillness in the chaos.

This was in 2000-2003, a time when my father got married and started his family, much like I find myself doing in a few years now. As I write this, my same sister is preparing for her wedding next month, marking yet another cycle of life. In a year or two, her kids would be listening to Arijit Singh while taking a nap. It's strange how nostalgia grips you—reminding you that what once felt like yesterday is now a memory of a distant past.

But each time we packed up and left, I saw the boulder rolling back down. We started building a new life, in a different city.

We moved to Kolkata in 2004. My father's job took us there. Leaving behind my gradnparents was difficult. They told me lores and magical tales of morality and ethics. We had gotten quarters in the company's colony. The colony, in Tallygunge, was a small one, it had two buildings one beside the other, a narrow entrance and common passage for both, and a small backyard. Towards the end the turning for the backyard used to be a bench. One side was buildings, and the other side was a tall wall. The watchman's name was Biswanath. I absolutely loved his room. He had a tiny matchbox room below the stairs, and he had a small window that opened to the main road. He used to sit there and read the newspaper. I used to sit beside him and watch the road.

This was situated on the main road, and a mosque was in the middle of the road. I used to figure out time by listening to the *azaan*. On the other side of the road was a sweet shop. Kolkata was a big city to us. The transition was already difficult for us, Odiyas, as we did not understand Bengali, and Kolkata was adamant on making us learn it. The city was loud, and the people were louder. Kolkata, in 2004, was a city of trams, and buses. However, our most convient method of commute was the metro.

We couldn't roam around in our bike like we used to, in Bhubaneswar. Luckily, the main road I lived by had a tram stop near the mosque. Memories of tram rides are still intact. They were lovely. I remember how the ticket looked, the bus conductor used to pull a rope tied to the roof, which was connected to a bell.

In 2007, two and a half years later, I found myself with my mother, and a distant cousin uncle in Asansol, yet again starting from the bottom of a different hill, a new boulder this time.

<!-- Each time, I find myself answering the same question: what does this even achieve? It feels futile, like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of building and rebuilding, always searching for something that remains just out of reach. But perhaps that is the point. After years of pushing the boulder up countless hills, I've come to realize that life isn't about reaching the summit. Like Sisyphus, perhaps the struggle itself is where we find meaning—an endless journey of rediscovery, with memories and experiences as the boulders we carry along the way. It is about taking the sourest lemons life has to offer and turning it into something resembling lemonade.

Only memories remain, and the journey is all that matters. After all, that's all we are, really, memories. And memories are all we leave behind. -->
