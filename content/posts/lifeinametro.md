I moved to Bangalore in June, and my living schematics changed drastically. I used to wake up at any time that I found suitable, mostly went out for breakfast, have fun at lunch and spent a ton of time with my friends. Now, the routine of waking up punctually, heading to the office, toiling away until late hours, and returning home solely to sleep has become the new norm.

When I arrived in this city, I found myself in quite a predicament. Laden with three large suitcases, and a backpack, a few small disposable bags, and with no place to call my own, I went to stay temporarily with my cousin who resided thirteen kilometers away from Koramangala, my office, in Electronic City. However, the daily commute between the two areas proved to be a headache due to the notorious traffic. It took me approximately 40 minutes to an hour each day to reach Koramangala, taking into account the traffic schedule and office timings.

Considering the exhausting daily commute and the need to be closer to my workplace, I decided to pack up my bags. After spending a week there, I sought refuge at a hostel called Zylo Stays in Koramangala. Drawn to its lively atmosphere and the promise of new connections, I eagerly settled into this temporary home, embracing the camaraderie of fellow inhabitants who shared a similar zest for exploration.

Living in the hostel was an experience filled with vibrant conversations and a melting pot of diverse cultures and backgrounds. However, the reality of sharing a small and cramped room with three other people soon became apparent. Despite the hostel's overall appeal, I faced a challenge with my roommates, who seemed unaware of personal boundaries. As someone sensitive to noise and a light sleeper, it became increasingly difficult for me to get a good night's sleep when they would enter the room late at night, turn on the lights, make noise, and leave the door open. It was a struggle to find the rest I needed amidst such disruptions. Consequently, my desire for a place where I could have privacy and create my own haven grew stronger. I lived there for a month and got a place of my own, in Koramangala, thereafter.

Koramangala boasts the highest rents in the city. It is also renowned as a thriving startup hub, attracting entrepreneurs and professionals from various industries. Living in Koramangala has its perks, especially when it comes to social life. The area is teeming with a wide array of food joints, pubs, and restaurants, offering an abundance of options for dining and entertainment. Whether you're in the mood for a casual night out with friends or a lively party, Koramangala has something for everyone. The vibrant atmosphere and bustling nightlife make it an ideal place to unwind and enjoy oneself to the fullest.

Banglore speaks money. Everywhere I go, I find myself deciding to earn more and more money possible. Moving here has brought forth a new set of responsibilities. I find myself cooking my own meals, taking care of laundry, and maintaining cleanliness in my house. Alongside these daily tasks, I also manage my finances, pay bills and ensure that I have enough left after covering rent, travel expenses, and food. Unfortunately, these costs often leave me with limited disposable income.

The daily commute in Bangalore is nothing short of exhausting. The city's notorious traffic poses a constant challenge, especially since I have yet to acquire my own vehicle. Relying on ride-hailing services like Uber, Namma-Yatri, and Ola has become a necessary but often expensive part of my routine. As I strive to navigate the urban jungle, the commute takes a toll on my energy and adds an extra layer of stress to my daily life.

Furthermore, the burden of household chores and managing finances leaves little time for other activities. In an attempt to alleviate some of these responsibilities, I am in the process of seeking a maid and a cook. Finding individuals who provide their services at reasonable prices is a priority, as it would allow me to focus on other aspects of my life.

Amidst the undeniable vibrancy and opportunities that Bangalore offers, there is no denying the inherent challenges it presents. The dense population and the constant hum of activity can be overwhelming, often leaving one yearning for moments of tranquillity amidst the chaos.

Moving to Bangalore has been tough on me. The city is extremely busy and noisy. The traffic is a nightmare. The house rent in most of the communities makes you go bonkers. Bangalore, often referred to as the "Valley" in India, attracts a diverse mix of people and cultures from all across the country who have migrated here to work and settle down. The city's nickname aptly represents the amalgamation of individuals, families, and cultures that coexist within its boundaries. However, amidst the charm of diversity, Bangalore poses its own set of challenges. The fast-paced lifestyle and the sheer volume of inhabitants can be overwhelming. Finding affordable housing in desirable neighbourhoods can be a struggle, placing financial strain on many residents.

Yet, despite the hardships, Bangalore is a city that continues to captivate and inspire. Its diversity and cosmopolitan nature allow for a vibrant fusion of cultures, traditions, and ideas. It offers a plethora of opportunities for personal and professional growth, fostering an environment where dreams can be pursued and ambitions can be realized. While surviving in this urban jungle may require resilience and adaptability, it is precisely the challenges and the dynamic nature of Bangalore that make it a captivating place to call home. Bangalore may be a whirlwind of activity, but I am hopeful that with time, I will carve out a niche for myself and discover the hidden gems this city has to offer.
