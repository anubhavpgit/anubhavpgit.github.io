This October, I hung our with my cousin, a serial entrepreneur who runs multiple franchises of a popular carrier provider. I saw him working first-hand, selling new plans and devices to customers, and I was amazed at how their business model works. 

Carrier providers have this excellent strategy of bundling services. They offer you the latest iPhone for free (at least they make it seem like that xD) if you are open to signing up for a contract. Now, the best part is that they know how to profit from this deal. They will somehow find a way to make you pay for that. You won't notice. And that's fine, really; you're paying what you were told and getting the latest iPhone for free, the same month it was launched. You're happy. The CAPEX is high, but the LTV is higher. I loved the customer acquisition strategy, and the way they managed to upsell and cross-sell.

To understand why this strategy works, let's break it down:

1. Bundling with Contracts: Carrier providers often bundle the latest devices (phones, tablets, watches) with long-term contracts. For example, they might offer the latest iPhone 16 Pro, which retails at $999, with a monthly mobile plan if you sign up for 24-36 months and trade in an old device. 

2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Large carriers usually buy flagship devices at a wholesale discount (10-30% below retail), meaning a $999 iPhone 16 Pro might cost them around $700-$900. Factoring in trade-in credits for old devices (worth $100-$200), the effective CAC for acquiring a customer can be as low as $600.

3. Lifetime Value (LTV): Now, if you’re on a single-user plan at $80-$90 per month, the carrier stands to earn between $2,400 and $3,600 over 24-36 months. Even with a CAC of $600, the Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost (LTV/CAC) ratio is about 4-5. The profit margin is amazing.

4. Premium Plan Options and Discounts: Higher-tier plans make the numbers even better. Suppose you choose an “ultimate” plan with a $100 monthly fee, inclusive of all features, and the carrier offsets your phone cost to $0. It might seem more profitable for you, but they’re still making between $2,400 and $3,600 over the contract term, even after factoring in the phone cost and trade-in credit. The LTV/CAC remains strong at around 4-5.

5. Family Plans and Additional Add-ons: Here's the best part. You might think that $90-$100 per line sounds high, so carriers encourage adding family members to reduce the per-line cost. Adding four family members drops each line’s cost to around $40-$50. Additionally, bundling home internet can reduce the cost per line to $30-$40, while still charging around $50-$60 for home internet. The LTV/CAC ratio increases. The profits increase 4-5 times. 

6. Getting Out: The carriers have a way of making you pay for the “free” phone. If you decide to leave the contract early, you’ll have to pay the remaining balance on the phone, which can be as high as $500-$700. This is how they make sure you stay with them for the entire contract term, for the entire 24-36 months. They do not mention that they will keep the phone carrier locked forever, but if you try to unlock it before your phone payment is done, you will have to pay the remaining balance. Even if you decide the entirity of the amount of the phone after the "trade-in" value, say $10-$20*$36 = $360-$720, the phone techincally still comes under as financed, and you will have to pay the remaining balance if you want to unlock it and use a different carrier. 

This model shows the incredible profit margins achieved through scale. Each customer pays a premium, and the more lines or add-ons they include, the higher the LTV per account. By the time all incentives and promotions are factored in, the carriers are making substantial returns on these seemingly generous offers. The EBIDTA margins come in at around 35-42%.

For Q3 2024, Verizon reported an EBITDA of approximately $12.3 billion. AT&T recorded an EBITDA of about $10.8 billion, and T-Mobile had an EBITDA of around $7.22 billion.

All of these experiences gave me insane insights into what it takes to run a business, the differences between consumer and business products, and how to sell them. I'm still uncertain about how well these lessons will translate to tech, but I'm excited to try them out.
