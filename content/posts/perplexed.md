Perplexity AI is a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) search engine that positions itself as a "Google killer". It is a product that has been built with the intention of providing users with a more efficient and effective way to search for information online, and entered the market at a time when the demand for such a solution was high. Is Perplexity AI still equally unique and promising in 2025?
