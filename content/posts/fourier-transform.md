Did you know that the keypad buttons on your phone have distinct frequencies? When you press a key, each number or symbol has a unique sound that is generated by the phone. Each sound is a combination of two distinct frequencies, a low-frequency tone and a high-frequency tone that are unique to that key. 

This is effectively how an IVR system works; when you call customer service and press 1, they have a program that listens to the frequencies generated by your phone and decodes them to determine which key you pressed. Try it out below:

   </button>

</div>

To break it down, images, shapes, and sound signals can be represented as a combination of different waves(frequencies). For example, when you press the number `5` on your phone, it generates a sound that is a combination of two frequencies: a low-frequency tone: 770 Hz and a high-frequency tone: 1336 Hz. These frequencies are unique to the number `5` and are used to identify the key that was pressed. 

Fourier analysis is a mathematical technique used to decompose periodic functions into their constituent frequencies and analyze the amplitude and phase of each frequency component. Some of the key applications of Fourier analysis include audio processing, audio filtering, noise reduction, signal reconstruction, image compression, feature extraction, and recognition, object detection, speech recognition among others.

Primarily, Fourier analysis is **decomposing** a time-domain signal into its constituent frequencies, and inferring the **amplitute** and **phase** of each constituent frequency to extract information.

# Fourier Analysis

Before moving on and messing up your mind with the math, here is a vague attempt at revisiting the basics:

## Recap

A wave is a disturbance that travels through a medium, and a signal is a wave that carries information. A wave has three main properties: amplitude, frequency, and phase. The amplitude is the height of the wave, the frequency is the number of cycles per second, and the phase is the position of the wave relative to a reference point.

### A Harmonic Wave: 

![Harmonic Wave](../assets/img/fourier-transform/harmonic-wave.png)

The equation $f(t) = A \sin(\omega t)$ represents a **simple harmonic wave** or oscillation. Below is a detailed breakdown:

1. $( A ) (Amplitude)$
   - $A$ is the **Amplitude** of the wave, representing the maximum value the function $f(t)$ can attain.
   - Physically, it indicates the peak deviation from the equilibrium position (e.g., the maximum height of the wave).


2. $(f) (Frequency)$
   - $f$ is the **Frequency** of the wave, measured in cycles per second (Hz); no. of oscillations(waves) per second.
   - It relates to the **angular frequency $\omega$** by:
     $f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}$; where $\omega = 2\pi f$
   - More the frequency, more the oscillations per second; more waves condensed in a given time( along the x-axis)more the pitch of the sound.

3. $( \omega ) (Angular Frequency)$
   - $( \omega )$ **Angular frequency**, measured in radians per second. It gives **how rapidly a system oscillates or rotates**.
   - It relates to the **period $T$** of the wave by:
     $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ ( 2œÄ radians is one full cycle, 360¬∞)
   - $T$ is the time it takes for the wave to complete one full cycle.

4. **$t$**:
   - $t$ represents **time**. It represents the time at which the wave is evaluated.


Suppose we have a wave with frequency $f = 2$ Hz; the wave oscillates 2 times per second, 
1. $T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ seconds. (One cycle is completed in 0.5 seconds)
2. $\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \times 2 = 4\pi$ radians per second. (2 cycles are completed in 1 second)

This equation describes many **periodic** phenomena, such as:
- A vibrating string.
- The oscillation of a pendulum.
- **Sound waves** or light waves (for small angles in the wave equation).

### Fourier Series

Any periodic or non-periodic function (signal) can be represented as a sum of sine and cosine waves of different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. The Fourier series is a mathematical tool that allows us to represent a periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines, and is given by:

#### Periodic Signals

For periodic signals (functions that repeat over time, with period T), a signal ùëì(ùë°) can be written as a sum of sine and cosine terms:

$$f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos(2\pi n f_0 t) + b_n \sin(2\pi n f_0 t)$$

where $f_0 = 1/T$ is the fundamental frequency of the signal, n is the harmonic number( no. of cycles in the signal), and $a_n$ and $b_n$ are the Fourier coefficients, calculated as follows:

$a_0 = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) dt$

$a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) \cos(2\pi n f_0 t) dt$

$b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) \sin(2\pi n f_0 t) dt$

Sound waves are periodic signals, and the Fourier series can be used to decompose them into their constituent frequencies. It is used in audio processing to analyze and manipulate sound signals. For non-periodic or discrete signals we use the Fourier transform to analyze the signal.

#### Non-Periodic Signals

Fourier Transform is a generalization of the Fourier series for non-periodic signals. It is used to analyze signals that are not periodic or are defined over a finite interval. The Fourier transform is given by:

$$F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt$$

where $F(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the signal $f(t)$, and $\omega$ is the frequency variable. The Fourier transform provides a representation of the signal in the frequency domain, showing the amplitude and phase of each frequency component.

The inverse Fourier transform is given by:

$$f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega$$

It allows us to reconstruct the original signal from its frequency components. The Fourier transform is widely used in signal processing, image processing, and many other fields to analyze and manipulate signals.

#### Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used to analyze discrete signals, such as digital signals or sampled signals, and is defined as:

$$X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j2\pi nk/N}$$

where $X[k]$ is the DFT of the signal $x[n]$, and N is the number of samples in the signal. The DFT is used in digital signal processing to analyze and process digital signals.
