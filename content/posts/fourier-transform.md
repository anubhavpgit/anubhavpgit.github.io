Did you know that the keypad buttons on your phone have distinct frequencies? When you press a key, each number or symbol has a unique sound that is generated by the phone. Each sound is a combination of two distinct frequencies, a low-frequency tone and a high-frequency tone that are unique to that key. 

This is effectively how an IVR system works. When you call customer service and press 1, they have a program that listens to the frequencies generated by your phone and decodes them to determine which key you pressed. Here is a breakdown of how this works.

# Recap

According to what I learnt in my high school physics, a wave is a disturbance that travels through a medium, and a signal is a wave that carries information. 

A wave has three main properties: amplitude, frequency, and phase. The amplitude is the height of the wave, the frequency is the number of cycles per second, and the phase is the position of the wave relative to a reference point.

## A Harmonic Wave: 

<!-- insert a diagram here explaining a wave -->


The equation $f(t) = A \sin(\omega t)$ represents a **simple harmonic wave** or oscillation. Below is a detailed breakdown:

1. $( A ) (Amplitude)$
   - $A$ is the **Amplitude** of the wave, representing the maximum value the function $f(t)$ can attain.
   - Physically, it indicates the peak deviation from the equilibrium position (e.g., the maximum height of the wave).

2. $( \omega ) (Angular Frequency)$
   - $( \omega )$ **Angular frequency**, measured in radians per second.
   - It relates to the **period $T$** of the wave by:
     $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$
   - $T$ is the time it takes for the wave to complete one full cycle.

3. **$t$**:
   - $t$ represents **time**. It represents the time at which the wave is evaluated.

4. **$\sin(\omega t)$**:
   - The sine function oscillates between $-1$ and $1$, creating a smooth, periodic waveform.

---
- The function $f(t) = A \sin(\omega t)$ oscillates periodically between $-A$ and $A$, with a period $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$.
- The **period** $T$ is the time it takes for the function to repeat its values.
- The **frequency** $f$, measured in cycles per second (Hz), is the reciprocal of the period: $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}$.

This equation describes many periodic phenomena, such as:
- A vibrating string.
- The oscillation of a pendulum.
- **Sound waves** or light waves (for small angles in the wave equation).


## Signals

Signals can be classified into two types: continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. Continuous-time signals are signals that are defined for all values of time, while discrete-time signals are signals that are defined only at discrete points in time.

A signal is periodic if it repeats itself after a certain period. The period of a signal is the smallest value of T for which the signal repeats itself. Any periodic or non-periodic function (signal) can be represented as a sum of sine and cosine waves of different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.

For periodic signals (functions that repeat over time, with period T), a signal ùëì(ùë°) can be written as a sum of sine and cosine terms:

$$f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos(2\pi n f_0 t) + b_n \sin(2\pi n f_0 t)$$

where $f_0 = 1/T$ is the fundamental frequency of the signal, and $a_n$ and $b_n$ are the Fourier coefficients.


### Fourier Series

The Fourier series is a mathematical tool that allows us to represent a periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines. It is a way to decompose a periodic function into its constituent frequencies. The Fourier series is given by:

### Fourier Series for Periodic Functions


### Fourier Transform for Non-Periodic Functions


### Discrete Fourier Transform


#### Why do we need Fourier Analysis?

Primarily, Fourier analysis is used for:

- **Decomposition**: Fourier analysis decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies.
- **Amplitude and Phase**: It provides information about the amplitude and phase of each frequency component.


**What does this help us achieve?**

Given a waveform with it's constituent frequencies and their amplitudes and phases, we can perform a variety of operations on the signal. Some of the common operations include:

- **Filtering**: It allows us to filter out unwanted frequencies from a signal.
- **Compression**: It helps in compressing signals by removing redundant information.
- **Noise Reduction**: It helps in reducing noise from a signal.
- **Signal Reconstruction**: It helps in reconstructing a signal from its frequency components.

## Applications

- **Audio Processing** - Fourier analysis is used in audio processing to separate the voice from the background noise. The microphone picks up the sound, and the Fourier transform is used to separate the voice from the background noise. Airpods, for example, use Fourier analysis to separate the voice from the background noise. The microphone picks up the sound, and the Fourier transform is used to separate the voice from the background noise. The voice is then transmitted to the other Airpod, and the background noise is canceled out.
