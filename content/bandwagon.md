AICTE(*All India Council for Technical Education*) states that approximately 1.5 million engineers graduate from India every year. Less than 3%, get into the creamy layer of tech jobs (*8-10+ LPA*), and the rest are left to fend for themselves.

The bandwagon effect is a psychological phenomenon in which people do something primarily because other people are doing it, regardless of their own beliefs, which they may ignore or override. This effect is often used to promote the adoption of new technologies, products, or standards. The bandwagon effect is a powerful form of groupthink and is a reason for the formation of fads and social trends.
