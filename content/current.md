##### Current, 2024

Happy new year, muchachos! I hope you had a good one. I will be starting a new career at RadiusAI as a Software Engineer. I am excited to work with the team and learn from them.

Meanwhile, I am exploring esoteric programming languages, and I am having a blast. Will be updating this page with my progress with brainfuck. I am also planning to brush up advanced data structures and algos. I will be spending most of my time on Leetcode and will share my progress here.
