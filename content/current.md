##### Current, 2024

Happy New Year, muchachos! I hope you had a good one. I just returned to Bangalore after a much-needed break in my hometown. Leaving home and returning to the city was a bit of a bummer, but such is life! The dreaded omicron variant is wreaking havoc in the city. I am starting a new career at RadiusAI as a Software Engineer, and I am pretty stoked :D

Here's an improved version of Llama Index's sub-querying engine used to generate SQL from Natural Language: [Neak](/blog/neak.html).

At RadiusAI, I am exploring Prefect and will be working on automating workflows in Python. I am also involved in the team that is building auto-checkout terminals for retail stores. I am working on building the POS system for the terminals.

On a personal trajectory, [Srijan](https://injuly.in) and I have identified a pain point in the developer tooling space. We are working on a solution to solve it. We are still in the early stages of the product, and I will be sharing more details soon.

Meanwhile, I am exploring esoteric programming languages, and I am having a blast. Will be updating this page with my progress with brainfuck. 

I am also planning to brush up on advanced data structures and algorithms. I will be spending most of my time on Leetcode and will share my progress here. Here is the list of topics that I am exploring:

- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, etc.)
- Heaps (Binary Heaps, Priority Queues)
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

Feel free to check out my leetcode profile [here](https://leetcode.com/anubhabr50/)

Coming onto Dough: a rich, modular, and customisable content generator, crafted in Rust; here's what's up with it:

- ~~Rendering Engine~~
- Templating Engine
- Footer
- Animations 
- Alignment 
- Syntax highlighting

I plan to finish up with dough by the end of this month. Later, I will be reviving [Bee](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b), a bit-torrent client I started working on a while back.

Finances are tough. I found a couple of interesting investment opportunities, and am learning more on investments and diversification of my portfolio. Will be updating my journey through investments here.
