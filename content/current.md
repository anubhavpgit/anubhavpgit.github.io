                        I hosted a session, <a

                        Chapter of Sit, BBS and it was a huge success.
                        We are planning to host a more advanced session on Git and GitHub in the near future. There's
                        also a web development workshop coming up.

                        Meanwhile, at IEEE, we arranged a talk show with Ramneek
                        Kalra that focused on getting to know IEEE and its benefits. The IEEE Students Chapter is
                        an organization dedicated to promoting knowledge and understanding of engineering. It
                        organization is run by students and offers a variety of benefits, including networking
                        opportunities, access to cutting-edge research, and professional development resources.

                        I have planned something exciting for me to hop onto once my college gets over. My primary
                        priority still remains the same, that is to work with one of the top tech companies, and work
                        on projects that I am really passionate about. While I go and hunt, <a
                            href="https://injuly.in">Srijan</a> and I have planned to start something of our own! The
                        egg has just been laid and we have still a lot of figuring out to do, but I am really excited
                        about it. I will keep you posted.

                        I am looking to to write blogs/papers on 'String Theory' in the near future. I have always been
                        intrigued by the theory and couldn't get my head to wrap around it.
                        However, now that my college years are coming to an end, I plan to dedicate my time to write
                        about it.
                        Another topic that I wanted to work on is 'Natural Language Models'. I intend to delve deeper
                        into exploring on how exactly natural language models work, the neural networks behind it, some
                        of the most popular models based on transformer architecture, like BERT, and GPT-3. You're
                        always welcome to <a href="mailto:anubhabr50@gmail.com"> reach out to me</a> if you want to
                        collaborate on any of these topics.

                        As I near the end of my four-not-so-long-year college journey, it feels like the end of an era.
                        Looking back, I am filled with immense gratitude for the incredible experiences and memories
                        that I have
                        garnered throughout my college life. I made lifelong friends, discovered
                        new passions, and grew both personally and professionally.

                        Reflecting on my journey, I recently bid adieu to the IEEE Students' Chapter, where I served as
                        the
                        President (Chairperson) for the past year. <a
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-viswabhusan/">Aditya</a> passed on the torch and I
                        did my best to keep it lit. I am proud of the
                        accomplishments of the chapter and the team that I worked with, and I hope that the chapter
                        continues to grow and thrive in the years to come. I still remember the day <a
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurav-jha-4a01341b1/">Saurav</a> sir and I established
                        SWITCH, the official coding club of the college. We wanted to establish a coding community for
                        students by conducting workshops, hackathons, and
                        coding competitions. I wish SWITCH all the best with its new management and hope it continues to
                        thrive.
                        I wanted to accomplish a lot with <a href="https://cbrtl.github.io">CBRTL</a> but maybe the
                        timing wasn't right.<a href="https://injuly.in"> Srijan</a> and I started <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://cbrtl.github.io">cbrtl</a>, a small, tight-knit group of programmers and
                        open-source sorcerers who like to craft fun projects together and
                        build a community.

                        While it is bittersweet to say goodbye to this phase of my life, I am eagerly looking forward to
                        embarking on a new chapter. With my sights set on new horizons, I am excited to see where life
                        takes me and to see what the future holds. I am exploring my options and scouring for opportunities. I intend to work with the biggest tech
                        companies, building products and creating differences.
