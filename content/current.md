###### January

Back in action: January was like an amazing much-needed magical vacation back home, and now I am back and it feels good. I met my cousins, family and relatives, ate a bunch of good Indian food, and spent a lot of time with my friends, still unsure how a month went by and if I was ready to get back to work. My sister got married, and I canâ€™t stop digesting this. She is just six months older than me, and we grew up together, inseparable. I am happy for her, but it feels like a part of me is missing. I canâ€™t wait to finish things here and rush back home.

My LinkedIn is filled with how Deepseek, an open-source LLM just killed it in the LLM space, and did it at less than 20-40 times the cost of OpenAI. The company has attracted attention in global AI circles after writing in a paper last month that the training of DeepSeek-V3 required less than $6 million worth of computing power from Nvidia H800 chips. This had a significant impact on the AI community, financial markets, and the world at large. On Monday, January 27, 2025, the stock closed at $118.42, marking a 17% drop from the previous close. This decline erased nearly $600 billion from NVIDIA's market capitalization, setting a record for the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock market history. Several models of DeepSeek like R1 are open-source. This democratization of AI is a big win for the community. It has unlocked a new era of AI-powered development with unparalleled potential to innovate solutions to the most pressing problems.

This year, I plan on building fewer projects and spending more time-solving Leetcode and preparing for interviews, as I am graduating by the end of this year. Currently, I am mostly involved in finishing up an old torrent project, fixing up a couple of bugs, and starting with Ferry, a C compiler for RISC-V written in Rust. This helps me learn more about computers and how they work at a lower level. 

Taking a break:

I am going back home, this month. If you're curious, I will be spending more time on my books, PS5, and Netflix in the next few weeks. Red Dead Redemption, Spiderman 2, Pulp Fiction, Godfather, and a long list await this new year. Hoping to gobble up good food for the rest of the year in this one-month break.

Hereâ€™s to new beginnings, and new adventures! ðŸ¥‚ I hope you have a great year ahead. Merry Christmas, and a happy New Year, everyone! Promise to be back soon. Keep checking :)
