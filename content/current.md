##### Current, 2023

[Settling down in Bangalore](/blog/lifeinametro.html) and looking forward to a new, competitive and exciting software engineering life here.

The past few months have been a whirlwind of new experiences for me. Navigating a new city, a fresh job, and an unfamiliar way of life has certainly kept me on my toes. I have been trying to get a hang of the new city, the new job and the new life. I got to attend a lot of networking events in Bangalore. At StackIt, we meet a lot of startups and enterprises and try to see if our product solves their problem. We went to Chargebee's Finance and Ops conference, Google IO Connect, and The Magic Ball event.  Each of these experiences provided valuable insights into the industry landscape and allowed us to make meaningful connections. Moreover, our recent involvement in YC's Startup School, focusing specifically on the AI domain, proved to be a significant milestone. This platform served as the launch pad for our AI vertical, marking a successful endeavour in this direction.

However, life threw me a curveball when I fell ill just last month. The diagnosis was a combination of dengue and a stomach ulcer, which necessitated a week-long hiatus to recover back home. My return to Bangalore revealed a turbulent living situation. Upon returning, my living situation in Bangalore became a roller coaster ride. I had to shift from where I was staying since the rent and overall expenses of the place shot up. There were a lot of unknowns and a ton of expenses that kept on piling up. My roommates did not inform me earlier about this and as soon as I paid the deposit,  I was confronted with a daunting list of a shitload of money that I need to pay more. As I refused to pay, they asked me to find a replacement, or else I would not get back the deposit.

Meanwhile, [Srijan](https://injuly.in) encountered his own housing predicament. His landlord's strict no-visitor policy left us with no option but to consider securing a place of our own. Amidst these challenges, my mother stepped in admirably, caring for me during my illness and remaining by my side upon my return to Bangalore. She stayed here for a month. Now, as she is gone I feel a bit lonely. I feel extremely homesick and want to live with my family.

Whilst I want to go back to my home, I also love the hustle and bustle of the city and want to build something here. This eternal dilemma is killing me. I am trying to find a balance between the two, and I hope I find it soon. This internal conflict is both frustrating and enriching, as it underscores the complexity of life's decisions. Striking a harmonious balance between these seemingly divergent paths is now my quest, and I am optimistic that clarity will eventually grace my journey.

I am still looking to write papers on String Theory and LLMs. Haven't gotten around to it yet.

Dev:

My current endeavours encompass a broad spectrum of technical challenges and innovations, ranging from plugin development and deployment optimization to AI-driven solutions that promise to transform the way we interact with data.

Engaged with [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com), I am working with Google AppScript, React, and Nodejs to build the StackIt Plugin. Our primary focus is on seamlessly integrating a payment infrastructure into the plugin.

Dealing with Google AppScript has proven somewhat challenging. The documentation is not that great and the community is not active. Meanwhile, within the cloud platform, our objective is to establish a clear demarcation between production, pre-production, and development environments for our plugin. We use Docker to create containers for each of these environments. Our current hurdle revolves around mapping multiple host ports to corresponding container ports, further complicated by our SSL certificate setup.

To streamline the Node.js and Docker deployment process, I've been experimenting with bash scripts, aiming to automate these tasks efficiently. For the React Project, I've successfully established a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline, facilitating deployments into the Google AppScript environment through Clasp. All of this is being built leveraging Github Actions.

While working on the AI vertical of StackIt, planning to invest time to understand the prompt engineering behind the entire infrastructure of Lookup AI.  Our strategic plan involves developing a platform that can effortlessly translate natural language queries into SQL, automating the entire data extraction and analysis process.
