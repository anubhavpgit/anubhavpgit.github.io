##### Current, 2023

October began with a bang. I had a lot of trips planned out. Smruti had just come back from Dubai, and while returning we planned to go on a trip to Dubai together! Meanwhile, my childhood friends and I had a week-long trek planned to Kedarnath, UK. Four of us, Mukul, Hritik, Hemant, and I were going to meet in Delhi and then head to Haridwar.

--- **A trek to Kedarnath** ---

I left from BLR to DEL via train and stayed with Mukul's sister for a day. Despite our tight schedule, we managed to explore, *Purani Dilli* for a day before Haridwar. Our day was filled with visits to iconic landmarks, including the magnificent Jama Masjid and the historic Red Fort. And obviously, we explored the amazing culinary places that I had bookmarked earlier and had multiple feasts there. 

We left for Haridwar at midnight and reached there at the break of dawn, around 4 in the morning. We scoured for cabs and found a cheap one right in front of the railway station, and went straight to Sonprayag. En route to our destination, we had the privilege of visiting numerous river confluences, each referred to as a "Prayag." The *Ganges* is formed at a place called *Devprayag*. From Sonprayag, we went to Gaurikund, the starting point of the trek to Kedarnath. It took us 12 odd hours to reach Gaurikund and we were exhausted. Sensibly, we decided to rest and begin the trek the next day. 

Woke up early the next day, freshened up, and prepared for the trek. Hemant and Mukul, exuding enthusiasm, pretty excited and looking all tough, shouldered their backpacks and set out for the trek's starting point. I was a bit sceptical of my skills. I pretty much knew I wouldn't be able to complete the entire trek. The 22-kilometer, steep journey seemed daunting. Hritik freshened up as well, and we all went ahead to start the trek. Mukul and Hemant were ahead of us. They didn't wait for me as I was slowing down everyone. Hritik walked with me and tried to push me to cover as much as I could and not take frequent breaks. Carrying a few extra kilos, I found it extremely cumbersome to trek. I had to pause every 100-200 meters, mustering every ounce of courage and strength to continue.

Somehow, I managed to trek for six and a half km. Hritik, Mukul and Hemant urged me to trek on a mule. The route offered mule transportation for those who found it challenging to ascend on foot. Initially, I was equally excited as the rest and didn't want to succumb and get on a mule. However, after enduring the gruelling climb of the first 6 kilometres, and considering the unanimous request from my friends, I realized that it would be unfair of me to hold back the group.

With Hritik by my side, we made the decision to mount mules and proceed with the journey. Upon reaching, we paid an incredibly high price for a plate of Maggie and halted. Mukul and Hemant reached after an hour, tired and looking like their souls were almost ready to succumb to fatigue. Hritik, Mukul, and Hemant set off in search of the campsite to rest and recuperate. Mukul looked as if he was on the brink of exhaustion and was borderline dead. I decided to hang back, explore the hills, and click photos.

I came to the tent after having witnessed the magnificent sunset that I saw up on the hill. All of us were tired and exhausted, and we went to sleep quickly and just woke up for dinner. During the night, the temperatures plummeted to a bone-chilling -3 degrees Celsius.

The following morning, we awoke from our snug sleeping bags and prepared to visit the temple, our spirits undeterred by the challenging conditions. We went near the temple, and the view was breathtaking. The temple was surrounded by snow-capped mountains, and the sun was shining brightly. We were all in awe of the beauty of the place. Hritik decided to buy gifts for his family and friends. We went ahead and bought some stuff for our families as well. After the shopping, we went ahead and stood in the queue for the temple. The queue was long, and it took us 3 hours to reach the temple. We heard that Mukesh Ambani had come to visit the place and the temple was closed for 3 tedious hours. Standing there for three hours, I eavesdropped on the conversations of the people around me. My mind got busy travelling to various places in various stories, exploring multiple characters and their view of rights and wrongs. I was lost in my own world until I heard the temple bells ringing.

We went inside the temple, and the atmosphere was serene. After returning to the campsite, we collected our belongings and I found out that my power bank had been stolen. With a heavy heart, we started our descent. We reached the campsite, and we were all tired. We had our dinner and slept.

The following day, we embarked on our journey to Haridwar, which took us 6 hours to reach Sonprayag. The return journey was beautiful. having successfully completed the trek, we were all in high spirits. We reminisced about our childhood days and the memories we had made. We were all happy and content. Hritik told us how hard the breakup was on him. While me and Mukul made fun of him. Hemant told us that he got a quarter where he later found out that someone had died and switched places. Now, he had to live with his brother while he awaited a new quarter. Somehow six hours passed, and we reached Haridwar.

After reaching Haridwar, we stowed our belongings in a room booked by Hemant. That evening, we roamed the enchanting streets, particularly around the ghats. It was a magical experience. As we explored the bustling markets of Haridwar, we indulged in a variety of food, finally catering to our appetites after being starved for 3 days. Hritik decided to bathe in the *Holy Ganga* and I joined him and dipped my feet in the sacred water. We also visited several temples, walking down memory lane, and reminiscing about our childhood days. We explored old paintings on the walls, discussing mythology and the stories behind them. We visited the *Har ki Pauri* ghat, where we witnessed the *Ganga Aarti*. The entire experience was surreal.

We had a train to catch at 11:30 p.m. We reached the station at 11:15 p.m. and then boarded the train. At 12, we left for Delhi. 

At that point, my journey took a different direction. While the rest of my friends remained in Haridwar, I boarded a train headed for Bhubaneswar, concluding this unforgettable adventure with memories that would last a lifetime.

Coming back home, I met my parents, Swayam and Khusi. Khusi had flown in from Dubai for the fall break, and we had decided to go visit Dubai together. The day after that, both Khusi and I embarked on our journey to Dubai, ready for the adventures and experiences that awaited us in this vibrant city.

--- **Marhaba, Dubai** ---

Dubai proved to be a surreal experience, marking my first international trip outside of India. As I boarded the flight, the first thing that caught my attention was the extended flight time. Our journey spanned 4 hours and 15 minutes from Bhubaneswar to Dubai International Airport.

Initially, I grappled with homesickness and longed to go back to Bangalore. However, after a few days, I gradually acclimated to the city, and my initial reservations gave way to enjoyment. I was amazed by cleanliness of the city. The roads were clean, and the people were disciplined. The architecture was magnificent. Dubai is a giant city inside a desert. The city is filled with skyscrapers, and the roads are wide. Moreover, the diversity of its population was striking, with people hailing from all corners of the globe, making Dubai a true global metropolis.

Dev:

At StackIt, we have decided to have a demo pitched each Saturday. We make presentations to show what we've built in the entire week. Inspired by this, a zeal to build my own presentation came rushing. Thus, I started [dough](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough): a rich, modular, command-line tool to generate presentations written in Rust. 

Meanwhile, I am planning to pick back up [Bee](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b): a command-line bit-torrent client to download torrents written in Rust. I am planning to rewrite the entire codebase in Rust. Currently, I am writing in TypeScript.

Research:

I am diving deeper into the world of AI, prompt engineering and fine-tuning LLMs to convert natural language to SQL queries. The need for this arose when we built an NL2SQL generator at StackIt, and it proved not to be entirely successful. The model was not able to generate SQL queries for complex questions. Thus, I am trying to understand the prompt engineering behind the entire infrastructure of Lookup AI. Our strategic plan involves developing a platform that can effortlessly translate natural language queries into SQL, automating the entire data extraction and analysis process.
