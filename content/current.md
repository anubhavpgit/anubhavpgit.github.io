##### Current, 2023

Ending this year with:

> "The night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you, the dawn is coming." - *Harvey Dent*

The rollercoaster of the year 2023 is coming to an end. I am glad to be back at home taking a break. Looking back, I am proud of myself for having come this far. This year has been a crucible of growth, and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had. Life is not a fairy tale, and I have had my fair share of ups and downs. But, with enough grit, effort, and love, you can make it the kind of movie you want it to be. Be it a comedy, a tragedy, a thriller, or even a fairy tale, it is up to you to decide. 

Here are some of the things that I have learnt this year, and wanted to share with you:

- Work harder. Your success is almost directly proportional to the amount of work you put in.
- Keep building. There is no end to learning. Growth doesn't foster in a comfort zone.
- The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it. You'll never be ready. Just start already.
- Visual form of learning is the slowest. Reading and writing are extremely fast alternatives.
- Be kinder. You never know what someone is going through. You can make the world a better place just by being a little kinder.
- Save. You never know when you might need it.
- Take trips. Roam around. Travel. See the world. There aren't enough places to see! (After saving, of course! :P)

The new year begins with a new job and a new hustle. I am looking forward to the next year, and I am excited to see what it has in store for me.

December brought forth a lot of major life changes. As with every good journey, there comes an end. I've wrapped up my tenure at StackIt after six fulfilling months. December serves as the last month of my journey at StackIt. I've had a great time working at StackIt. This team is the most hard-working, and the most talented team that I have worked with. Leaving StackIt with a heavy heart full of gratitude and memories. Meanwhile, looking forward to the next step in my career.

A couple of interns are also leaving, so we decided to go on a company trip to Gokarna. We had a great time at the beach. We went on a trek, had tons of food, and partied a lot on the beach. I've made a lot of friends at StackIt, and I'm going to miss them. I got to learn a lot from them, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked with them. Here are the [pics of the trip](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17910685385785563/). We also went out for Go-karting and gaming. I had a great time with the team.

Now, I'm in transition, on the lookout for the next step in my career. The excitement and dread of embarking on a new professional journey is overwhelming. Meanwhile, I have uncovered a new pain point in the developer tooling market, and I'm working on a solution. I am planning to build something of my own.

As November came to an end; with merely a month left, I looked at my resolutions for this year and wondered if I even came close to starting them. Contemplating the decisions that I took in these past eleven months, I pondered on how much I had progressed.

This year, I

- Graduated College
- Got a Job/ started my entrepreneurial journey
- Moved to Bangalore; started living away from home
- Somehow managed to make money, and send some back home; started paying my bills
- Started paying taxes


By the end of this year, I want to have 

- built more projects
- read and written more 
- become more fit than I was in January
- built a solid plan for the next two to three years

Before beginning 2024, I want to have grown to look back at 2023 and be proud of myself; thus, I will be working on myself for the next month. 

The festive season in Nov is always a busy time for us Indians. It brings forth long weekends, leaves, and holidays. Corporate folks save up leaves and vacation days to go back home and cherish the season with friends and family. I, too, went back home for this Diwali. We had a Puja at home, and I met my extended family. It was a weekend of fun and a break from my work life. I got chocolates for Sneha and got her a neck pillow. Both my sisters had their birthday at the beginning of November, and I had to get each of them gifts. 

Returning from home is always a challenge. The dreaded steps that I take on mornings when I know I have a flight to catch are the worst. This time too, I did not want to return and with each breath that I took, I wished somehow magically I wouldn't have to leave my home, and yet I would be employed and earning a living. I had to leave, and with a heavy heart I mustered all courage inside me, and I did. Rio never gets why I have to leave. He is always by my side whenever I am in my home and tries his best to not let me leave my room. There are things that humans do that dogs do not understand, like leaving. I wish I could explain to him that I have to leave, and I will be back soon. While he knows that I will be back someday, he still makes those puppy eyes, unable to speak up or do anything, just looks at me leave. If only I could explain that leaving is a transient inevitability!

The following week was a stressful one. At Stackit, I had a lot of pending tasks on the backlog. While back at home I had to prepare for an important test. The highlight of the week was watching India go into finals in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup. Even though I am not a sports fan, looking at my country at the top of the leaderboard, undefeated, making its way to win the finals made me proud.

October began with a bang. I had a lot of trips planned out. Khusi had just come back from Dubai, and while returning we planned to go on a trip to Dubai together! Meanwhile, my childhood friends and I had a week-long trek planned to Kedarnath, UK. Four of us, Mukul, Hritik, Hemant, and I were going to meet in Delhi and then head to Haridwar.

Tech:

I am looking to upgrade my entire desk setup. I realized I am spending more time on my desk writing blogs and coding, thus I'm looking to invest in a mechanical keyboard, an ergonomic mouse, a comfortable chair, and a new monitor.

I have been using an HP-GK320 wired keyboard with Blue switches for a long time, which is cheap and provides an okayish experience. The Lenovo Legion gaming mouse also serves well. I've been eyeing a mechanical keyboard, the Ducky One 2 SF for a while, and I'm eager to experience the tactile and audible feedback they provide. I am also planning to decide on an ergonomic mouse. The Logitech MX Master 3S looks attractive but I haven't settled on anything yet.

I was using the Acer Ed320QR monitor, which was a 32" curved monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate. However, I found the monitor to be lacking in terms of colour accuracy and resolution. I have upgraded to the LG Ultragear 32" since it supports WQHD @165Hz, has HDR10, is 99% sRGB accurate and colour calibrated.

I had gotten a cheap chair from the local market, which was initially comfortable until it broke. I tried fixing it, but it is not comfortable anymore and is still somewhat faulty. I am planning to get a new chair, and I am looking at the Green Soul Zodiac Pro Series chair.

I am planning to polish up my Data Structures and Algorithms, and my profile. Looking at the current market it is evident that only the skilled ones make it to the top. 

I am currently working on building an Nl2SQL engine for StackIt. A platform that can effortlessly translate natural language queries into SQL, automating the entire data extraction and analysis process. The tech behind this would involve vectorizing SQL schemas and using a multi-query engine to find the appropriate schema-embedding section to send to the LLM to generate SQL queries.

At StackIt, we have decided to have a `demo pitch round` each Saturday. We make presentations to show what we've built in the entire week. Inspired by this, a zeal to build my own presentation came rushing. Thus, I started [Dough](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough): a rich, modular, command-line tool to generate presentations written in Rust. 

Meanwhile, I am planning to pick back up [Bee](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/b): a command-line bit-torrent client to download torrents written in Rust. I am looking to explore esoteric programming languages and look into the brainfuck interpreter. Curious about game dev, I am also looking to get my hands dirty with tactical FPS/ open-world games.

I am diving deeper into the world of AI, prompt engineering and fine-tuning LLMs to convert natural language to SQL queries. The impetus for this exploration stemmed from the shortcomings of an NL2SQL generator at StackIt, prompting a quest for a robust platform automating SQL generation from natural language queries. The model was not able to generate SQL queries for complex questions. Thus, I am trying to understand the prompt engineering behind the entire infrastructure of Lookup AI. Our strategic plan involves developing a platform that can effortlessly translate natural language queries into SQL, automating the entire data extraction and analysis process.
