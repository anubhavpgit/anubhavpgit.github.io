##### April, 2023

I recently visited Bangalore and met with my friends. We had a great time and I am looking forward to meeting them again. I went to Bangalore to explore a new idea. I have planned something exciting for me to hop onto once my college gets over. My primary priority remains the same, which is to work with one of the top tech companies and work on projects that I am really passionate about. While I go and hunt for jobs, [Srijan](https://injuly.in) and I have planned to start something of our own! The egg has just been laid and we have still a lot of figuring out to do, but I am really excited about it.

I hosted a session, [Git Groove](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anubhabpatnaik0530_git-groove-getting-into-the-rhythm-of-version-activity-7050527332519862272-jniz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop): Getting into the rhythm of version control with Git & GitHub with UnStop Chapter of Sit, BBS and it was a huge success. We are planning to host a more advanced session on Git and GitHub shortly. There's also a web development workshop coming up.

Meanwhile, at IEEE, we arranged a talk show with Ramneek Kalra that focused on getting to know IEEE and its benefits. The IEEE Students Chapter is an organization dedicated to promoting knowledge and understanding of engineering. It organization is run by students and offers a variety of benefits, including networking opportunities, access to cutting-edge research, and professional development resources.

I am looking to write blogs/papers on 'String Theory' soon. I have always been intrigued by the theory and couldn't get my head to wrap around it. However, now that my college years are coming to an end, I plan to dedicate my time to writing about it. Another topic that I wanted to work on is 'Natural Language Models'. I intend to delve deeper into exploring how exactly natural language models work, the neural networks behind them, and some of the most popular models based on transformer architecture, like BERT, and GPT-3. You're always welcome to reach out to me if you want to collaborate on any of these topics.

Currently, I am working with [Adyquate](https://adyquate.com), a digital marketing startup.

Lately, I've been working on a custom bit-torrent client to download files and movies based on recommendations from my [movie recommendation system](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/Movie-recommendation) and a [movie rating prediction system](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/Movie-rating-prediction). I'm planning to port it to Rust later.

Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and will be working on a brainfuck interpreter.

Dev:

- [BitTorrent client]( https://github.com/fuzzymfx/bittorrent-client)
  - Add feat. download using magnet links
  - Finishing the project
  - Porting the torrent client from ts to rust

As I near the end of my four-not-so-long-year college journey, it feels like the end of an era. Looking back, I am filled with immense gratitude for the incredible experiences and memories that I have garnered throughout my college life. I made lifelong friends, discovered new passions, and grew both personally and professionally.

Reflecting on my journey, I recently bid adieu to the IEEE Students' Chapter, where I served as the President (Chairperson) for the past year. [Aditya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-viswabhusan/) passed on the torch and I did my best to keep it lit. I am proud of the accomplishments of the chapter and the team that I worked with, and I hope that the chapter continues to grow and thrive in the years to come. I still remember the day [Saurav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurav-jha-4a01341b1/) sir and I established SWITCH, the official coding club of the college. We wanted to establish a coding community for students by conducting workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions. I wish SWITCH all the best with its new management and hope it continues to thrive. I wanted to accomplish a lot with [CBRTL](https://cbrtl.github.io/) but maybe the timing wasn't right. [Srijan](https://injuly.in) and I started cbrtl, a small, tight-knit group of programmers and open-source sorcerers who like to craft fun projects together and build a community.

While it is bittersweet to say goodbye to this phase of my life, I am eagerly looking forward to embarking on a new chapter. With my sights set on new horizons, I am excited to see where life takes me and to see what the future holds. I am exploring my options and scouring for opportunities. I intend to work with the biggest tech companies, building products and creating differences.
