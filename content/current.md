###### December'24 - January'25

New York City is as beautiful as ever. The streets are filled with lights, and the air is filled with the sound of Christmas carols. The city is bustling with magic, love and happiness, and the festive season is in full swing. With the onset of this new year, I plan on taking a break from everything and visiting home, back in Bhubaneswar.

Taking a break:

I realized I was too busy trying to work on my projects and knee-deep in useless academics that now, after hardly a month left to a new year, I find it difficult to comprehend how an entire year went by. It feels as if I graduated just a couple of months ago, but two years have gone by, and I am here, in New York, trying to make sense of my life. 

If youâ€™re ever curious, I will be spending more time on my books, PS5, and Netflix. RDR series, Spiderman2, Pulp Fiction, Godfather, and a long list await this new year. Hereâ€™s to new beginnings, and new adventures! ðŸ¥‚ I hope you have a great year ahead. Merry Christmas, and a happy New Year, everyone! Promise to be back soon. Keep checking :)
