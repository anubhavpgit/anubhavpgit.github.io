##### Current, 2023

October began with a bang. I had a lot of trips planned out. Smruti had just come back from Dubai, and while returning we planned to go on a trip to Dubai together! Meanwhile, my childhood friends and I had a week-long trek planned to Kedarnath, UK. Four of us, Mukul, Hritik, Hemant, and I were going to meet in Delhi and then head to Haridwar.

--- **Kedarnath** ---

I left from BLR to DEL via train and stayed with Mukul's sister for a day. Despite our tight schedule, we managed to explore, *Purani Dilli* for a day before Haridwar. Our day was filled with visits to iconic landmarks, including the magnificent Jama Masjid and the historic Red Fort. And obviously, we explored the amazing culinary places that I had bookmarked earlier and had multiple feasts there. 

We left for Haridwar at midnight and reached there at the break of dawn, around 4 in the morning. We scoured for cabs and found a cheap one right in front of the railway station, and went straight to Sonprayag. En route to our destination, we had the privilege of visiting numerous river confluences, each referred to as a "Prayag." The *Ganges* is formed at a place called *Devprayag*. From Sonprayag, we went to Gaurikund, the starting point of the trek to Kedarnath. It took us 12 odd hours to reach Gaurikund and we were exhausted. Sensibly, we decided to rest and begin the trek the next day. 

Woke up early the next day, freshned up, and preapred for trek. Hemant and Mukul, exuding enthusiasm, pretty excited and looking all tough,shouldered their backpacks and set out for the trek's starting point. I was a bit skeptical of my skills. I pretty much knew I wouldn't be able to complete the entire trek. The 22-kilometer, steep journey seemed daunting. Hritik freshned up as well, and we all went ahead to start the trek. Mukul and Hemant were ahead of us. They didn't wait for me as I was slowing down everyone. Hritik walked with me, tried to push me as much as I can. Carrying a few extra kilos, I found it extremely cumbersome and tiresome to trek. I had to pause every 100-200 meters, mustering every ounce of courage and strength to continue.

Somehow, I managed to trek 6 and a half km. Hritik, Mukul and Hemant urged to trek on a mule. The route offered mule transportation for those who found it challenging to ascend on foot. Initially, I was equally excited as the rest and didn't want to succumb and get on a mule. However, after enduring the grueling climb of the first 6 kilometers, and considering the unanimous request from my friends, I realized that it would be unfair to hold back the group.

With Hritik by my side, we made the decision to mount mules and proceed with the journey. Upon reaching, we piad an increadably high price for maggie, and halted. Mukul and Hemant reached after an hour, all tired and looking like their souls almost ready to succumb to fatigue. Hritik, Mukul, and Hemant set off in search of the campsite to rest and recuperate. Mukul looked as if he was on the brink of exhaustion and was boderline dead. I decided to hang back, explore the hills, click photos.
