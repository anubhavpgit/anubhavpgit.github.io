##### Reading List

- [x]  A Thousand Splendid Suns *- Khaled Hosseini*: A novel about the lives of two girls in Afghanistan, and how their lives intertwine. I've read this book before, but I wanted to revisit it.
- [x]  The three body problem *- Cixin Liu*: A sci-fi novel about the first contact between humans and an alien civilization, set in China during the cultural revolution. Initially I found it slow-paced, but it picks up pace after the first few chapters.
- [ ]  Dune *- Frank Herbert*
- [x]  A Thousand Years of Pain *- Moeen VN* A mythological thriller, set in early India. I met the author on Chruch Street and he gave me a copy of the book. It's a good read for a beginner. The ending made me want to read the second part, which is not out yet.
