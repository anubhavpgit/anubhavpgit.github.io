##### Watching 

- [x] Community *- Dan Harmon*: A sitcom about a group of misfits in a community college. Amazing show. Great humor, wholesome, but might not cater to younger audiences. Has a lot of pop culture references.
- [x] Mad Men *- Matthew Weiner*: A period drama set in the 1960s, about an advertising agency.
- [ ] After Life *- Ricky Gervais*: A dark comedy

Yet to watch:

- [ ] The Umbrella Academy *- Steve Blackman*: A superhero show about a dysfunctional family of superheroes. The show is based on a comic book series of the same name. I am yet to complete this.
- [ ] The Witcher
- [ ] Peaky Blinders
- [ ] Shameless
- [ ] Farzi
