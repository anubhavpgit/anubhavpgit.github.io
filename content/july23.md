##### July - September, 2023

[Settling down in Bangalore](/blog/lifeinametro.html) and looking forward to a new, competitive and exciting software engineering life here. The new house is lovely and living with my best friends solves more problems than I anticipated. I am trying to make out time of my schedule to play the guitar more, write more, work on my projects, and also polish up my data structures and algorithms as well. For a good part of my adulthood, I tried to avoid investments and always had my dad take care of them. Now, I have decided to learn more about stocks, investments and the pile of cash surrounding it. I aspire to be physically fit, but my appetite for junk food has spread like wildfire. I am trying to get into a routine and lose a considerable amount of weight before hitting the gym.

The past few months have been a whirlwind of new experiences for me. Navigating a new city, a fresh job, and an unfamiliar way of life has certainly kept me on my toes. I have been trying to get a hang of the new city, the new job and the new life. I got to attend a lot of networking events in Bangalore. At StackIt, we meet a lot of startups and enterprises and try to see if our product solves their problem. We went to Chargebee's Finance and Ops conference, Google IO Connect, and The Magic Ball event.  Each of these experiences provided valuable insights into the industry landscape and allowed us to make meaningful connections. Moreover, our recent involvement in YC's Startup School, focusing specifically on the AI domain, proved to be a significant milestone. This platform served as the launch pad for our AI vertical, marking a successful endeavour in this direction.

However, life threw me a curveball when I fell ill just last month. The diagnosis was a combination of dengue and a stomach ulcer, which necessitated a week-long hiatus to recover back home. My return to Bangalore revealed a turbulent living situation. I had to shift from where I was staying since the rent and overall expenses of the place shot up. There were a lot of unknowns and a ton of expenses that kept on piling up. My roommates did not inform me earlier about this and as soon as I paid the deposit,  I was confronted with a daunting list of a shitload of bills that I needed to clear. As I refused to pay, they asked me to find a replacement, or else I would not get back the deposit.

Meanwhile, [Srijan](https://injuly.in) encountered his own housing predicament. His landlord's strict no-visitor policy left us with no option but to consider securing a place of our own. Amidst these challenges, my mother stepped in admirably, caring for me during my illness and remaining by my side upon my return to Bangalore. She stayed here for a month. Now, as she is gone I am in profound sadness. I feel extremely homesick and all I want to do is live with my family.

In between all this chaos, [Khusi](https://smrutidash.com) flew all the way from Dubai to come to visit me in Bangalore. An entire weekend of fun and frolic ensued, as we explored the city and enjoyed each other's company. It was a much-needed break from the stress of the past few weeks. Two days felt like what was a few hours, and I cherished every moment of it. She left on a Sunday night, and I was back to the grind. I felt extremely grateful to have my mother and Khusi by my side. I do not know how I would have managed without them. These are times when I just sit back and wonder how much life has given me and amongst a busy schedule, tough job, less money, and hundreds of whatnots, I have a thousand reasons to be grateful and happy.

Whilst I want to go back to my home, I also love the hustle and bustle of the city and want to build something here. This eternal dilemma is killing me. I am trying to find a balance between the two. Bangalore brings out hope, discomfort, moulding and shaping me in different forms, challenging me while providing me with growth and success. On the other hand, my home is a place of comfort, love, and familiarity, and provides with a sense of belonging.

This internal conflict is both frustrating and enriching, as it underscores the complexity of life's decisions. Striking a harmonious balance between these seemingly divergent paths is now my quest, and I am optimistic that clarity will eventually grace my journey.

Dev:

My current endeavours encompass a broad spectrum of technical challenges and innovations, ranging from plugin development and deployment optimization to AI-driven solutions that promise to transform the way we interact with data.

Engaged with [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com), I am working with Google AppScript, React, and Nodejs to build the StackIt Plugin. Our primary focus is on seamlessly integrating a payment infrastructure into the plugin.

Dealing with Google AppScript has proven somewhat challenging. The documentation is not that great and the community is not active. Meanwhile, within the cloud platform, our objective is to establish a clear demarcation between production, pre-production, and development environments for our plugin. We use Docker to create containers for each of us developers and separate virtual machines for each of the environments. Our current hurdle revolves around mapping multiple host ports to corresponding container ports, further complicated by our SSL certificate setup.

To streamline the Node.js and Docker deployment process, I've been experimenting with bash scripts, aiming to automate these tasks efficiently. For the React Project, I've successfully established a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline, facilitating deployments into the Google AppScript environment through Clasp. All of this is being built leveraging Github Actions. I am also working on refactoring the code base to make it more robust, modular and readable.

While working on the AI vertical of StackIt I am planning to invest time to understand the prompt engineering behind the entire infrastructure of Lookup AI. Our strategic plan involves developing a platform that can effortlessly translate natural language queries into SQL, automating the entire data extraction and analysis process.

Research:

I am still looking to write papers on String Theory and LLMs. Haven't gotten around to it yet.
