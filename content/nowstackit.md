StackIt: The no-code automation tool for spreadsheets. I am working with Stackit to build Stackit: a google workspace add-on that streamlines the process of importing data from a multitude of aggregators, including popular platforms like Chargebee, Stripe, Shopify, as well as databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. Say goodbye to the daunting task of writing complex SQL queries, the need to hire data engineers, or the expense of using high-end business intelligence (BI) tools.

StackIt empowers you to automate the data importing process into your spreadsheets, making it more efficient and hassle-free. By eliminating the need for coding, StackIt enables users of all technical backgrounds to effortlessly create connections with various data sources and seamlessly import relevant data into their spreadsheets.
