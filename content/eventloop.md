*"JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java."* - MDN

## Languages and their intricasies

### Setting the stage: The working of languages

Programming languages are a set of instructions that are executed by a computer. These instructions are written in a human-readable format and are converted into machine code by a compiler or an interpreter. The machine code is then executed by the computer. The compiler or the interpreter is responsible for converting the human-readable code into machine code. The compiler converts the code into machine code before the execution of the program. The interpreter converts the code into machine code during the execution of the program.

### JavaScript: The odd one out

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent language. It is the only language that is executed on the client-side.
