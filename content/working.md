###### Next up:

- A research paper on image/audio analyzer/decomposer to convert svg to png and vice-versa; decomposing periodic functions using fourier series approximation
- Disecting a research paper on consistent, memory-safe fast, read/write distributed database built in Go/Rust that implements a distributed caching mechanism like [docstore](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/how-uber-serves-over-40-million-reads-per-second-using-an-integrated-cache/) or [memcached](https://memcached.org/)
- Product design and strategy for a potential AI powered fitness product- [Jude](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/heyjude) 

###### Recent Projects:

- A functional prototype of a neural sensor device to capture finger movements to be used as an input for a AR/VR device.
- [Ferry](https://github.com/anubhavpgit/ferry) - A C compiler for RISC-V, capable of compiling the code for a subset of C language (potentially scalable enough to solve LeetCode problem set.)
- Improvements in [Zuzu](https://github.com/anubhavpgit/anubhavpgit.github.io) - Added a custom fuzzy search engine with the BM25 ranking algorithm.
- [Fireside](https://github.com/anubhavpgit/fireside) - An encrypted, decentralized chat app built with GunJS & Svelte, enabling low-latency, secure, and ephemeral messaging. - [Live](https://anubhavp.dev/fireside/)
- [Game of Life](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/gameoflife.html)- Implementing John Conway's Game of Life and explaining building CPU units using it
- [A RISCV machine code interpreter](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/hacktoberfest)-  a pipelined processor executing machine code instructions with hazard handling and memory safety
- [A RISCV machine code decoder](https://anubhavp.dev/barney)-  a simple machine code to assembly decoder that converts machine code to assembly instructions
- Improvements in [Zuzu](https://github.com/anubhavpgit/zuzu) - Imrpoving perfromance handling and added banner images support in the custom static site generator for my site ([anubhavp.dev](https://anubhavp.dev/))
- [Dough](https://github.com/anubhavpgit/dough): a rich, modular, and customisable content generator written in Rust.
- A full-fledged telegram and discord bot to mimic the entire functionality set of [datingAi](datingai.pro) with optimzed API calls limiting exhaustion.

Also **looking for maintainers** for [Resoc](https://resoc.in) ( A basic React webpage to host notes for my undergrad college from SIT, BBS).
