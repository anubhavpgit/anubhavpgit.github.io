###### Next up:

- An image/audio analyzer/decomposer to convert svg to png and vice-versa; decomposing periodic functions using fourier series approximation
- A (short MVP) C/C++ compiler for RISC-V.
- A consistent, memory-safe fast, read/write distributed database built in Go/Rust that implements a distributed caching mechanism like [docstore](https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/how-uber-serves-over-40-million-reads-per-second-using-an-integrated-cache/) or [memcached](https://memcached.org/)
- Getting hands dirty with LLM Ops: Building a custom AI assisted nutrition manager (A purely personal project)

###### Recent Projects:

- [Game of Life](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/gameoflife.html)- Implementing John Conway's Game of Life and explaining building CPU units using it
- [A RISCV machine code decoder](https://anubhavp.dev/barney)-  a pipelined processor executing machine code instructions with hazard handling and memory safety
- Improvements in [Zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu) - The custom static site generator for my site ([anubhavp.dev](https://anubhavp.dev/))
- [Dough](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/dough): a rich, modular, and customisable content generator written in Rust.
- A full-fledged telegram and discord bot to mimic the entire functionality set of [datingAi](datingai.pro) with optimzed API calls limiting exhaustion.

Also *looking for maintainers for [Resoc](https://resoc.in) ( A basic React webpage to host notes for my undergrad college from SIT, BBS).

Feel free to [DM](mailto:anubhabr50@gmail.com) if interested in working together.
