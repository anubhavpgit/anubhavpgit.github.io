Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship. I am currently working on compilers, pixel-art converters, distributed systems, high-performance caching databases, LLM Ops, and more.

Working as an AI product engineer intern at [YourMove.AI](https://yourmove.ai) part-time, building verticals to acquire users and drive growth, and an AI research engineer building a cinematic video generation engine at [h011yw00d](https://x.com/h011yw00dAgent/). Previously worked as a software engineer at [RadiusAI](https://radius.ai/) and as the founding engineer at [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com) before that. Currently, a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at New York University, Tandon. This site is for my monthly logsâ€”my two cents and musings on life and tech. This is my journey [so far <i class="fa-arrow-right icon" ></i> ](/journey.html).

Fond of tales and lore, I venture into [narrative writing](/blog/#life), exploring the art of storytelling. I love poetry and music, play a little guitar, indulge in [photography](/mementos.html), and dabble in [graphic design](https://dribbble.com/anubhabpatnaik). Besides, a big-time foodie, love to adventure and explore places, and attend tech meetups. More on [what I am up to <i class="fa-arrow-right icon" ></i> ](/current.html).

I'm based out of NYC, so if you're nearby, feel free to reach out. We could chat about startups, dive into some code, or collaborate on a project.
