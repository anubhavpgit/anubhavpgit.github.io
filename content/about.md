Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik("fuzzymf"), a software engineer from India. Interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I try to solve real-world problems. I previously worked as a software engineer at [RadiusAI](https://radius.ai/), and as the founding engineer at [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com) before that. Currently, a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at New York University, Tandon. This is a space for my philosophical thoughts and monthly updates; my two cents and musings on life and tech. Here's my [journey so far <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" ></i> ](/journey.html).

I [write about life](/blog), love poetry and music, and have recently taken up playing the guitar. I also have a penchant for [travelling, adventuring, exploring places](https://anubhavp.dev/explored), [photography](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks), and [graphic design](https://dribbble.com/fuzzymf). Fond of stories, I try to take time out to [read](https://anubhavp.dev/reading.html) more. Besides, I attend events related to space exploration and tech startups.

Daydreamer, writer, philosopher. Fond of tales and myths, I try to take time out to [read and watch](https://anubhavp.dev/reading.html), [write about the alchemy of life](/blog), chronicling the magic and storms that shaped my journey.

Once upon a time in a realm of endless possibilities, a soul . This wayfarer, armed with verses and visions, strummed the strings of a guitar, creating melodies that danced with the fireflies under the moonlit sky. Amidst ancient ruins and whispering woods, I [traveled, adventured, and explored](https://anubhavp.dev/explored), each step a stroke on the canvas of my odyssey. With a lens to see the unseen, I captured moments of transient beauty, sharing them with the world through my [photographs](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks) and [designs](https://dribbble.com/fuzzymf). In the quiet corners of bustling bazaars or beneath the star-studded cosmos, I delved into the pages of forgotten tales, seeking wisdom in the [scrolls I read](https://anubhavp.dev/reading.html). As the stars charted my course, I frequented gatherings of stargazers and dreamers, where tales of celestial voyages and technological marvels were spun. To discover more about my ongoing quests and the enchantments of everyday, venture forth to [what I am up to <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" ></i>](/current.html).
