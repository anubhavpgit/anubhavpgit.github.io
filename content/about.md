Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik("fuzzymf"), a software engineer from India. Interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I build scalable and robust systems to solve real-world problems. I am currently working on compilers, distributed systems and databases, LLM Ops, and more. 

I previously worked as a software engineer at [RadiusAI](https://radius.ai/), and as the founding engineer at [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com) before that. Currently, a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at New York University, Tandon. This is a space for my philosophical thoughts and monthly updates; my two cents and musings on life and tech. Here's my [journey so far <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" ></i> ](/journey.html).

I [write](/blog) about life and tech, and love poetry and music. Fond of tales and lores, I try to carve out time to [read](https://anubhavp.dev/reading.html) more. I also have a penchant for [travelling, adventuring, exploring places](https://anubhavp.dev/explored), [photography](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks), and [graphic design](https://dribbble.com/fuzzymf). Besides, I attend gatherings related to space exploration and tech startups. More on [what I am up to <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" ></i> ](/current.html).

I'm currently based in NYC, so if you're nearby, feel free to reach out. We could chat about startups, dive into some code, or collaborate on a project together.
