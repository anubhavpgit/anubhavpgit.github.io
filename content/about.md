Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India interested in math, engineering, and entrepreneurship. I am currently working on social-media apps, pixel-art converters, distributed systems, and high-performance caching databases.

I live in New York and work as a software developer at [Authentic](https://authentic.tech/), an ephemeral, privacy-focused social media app. Previously, I worked as an AI research engineer building a cinematic video generation engine at [h011yw00d](https://x.com/h011yw00dAgent/), as a software engineer at [RadiusAI](https://radius.ai/) before that, and was the founding engineer at [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com) before that. Also, a grad student pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at New York University. This site is for my monthly logsâ€”my two cents and musings on life and tech.

Fond of tales and lore, I venture into [narrative writing](/blog/#life), exploring the art of storytelling. I love poetry and music, play a little guitar, indulge in [photography](/mementos.html), and dabble in [graphic design](https://dribbble.com/anubhabpatnaik). Besides, I am a big-time foodie and love to adventure and explore places. More on [what I am up to<i class="fa-arrow-right icon" ></i> ](/current.html).

If you're in or around NY or just want to chat, feel free to reach out. We could chat about startups, dive into some code, or collaborate on a project.
