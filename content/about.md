Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik("fuzzymf"), a software engineer from India. Interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I build software to solve real-world engineering problems. I am currently working on compilers, pixel-art converters, distributed systems, databases, LLM Ops, and [more](/current.html). 

I previously worked as a software engineer at [RadiusAI](https://radius.ai/) and as the founding engineer at [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com) before that. Currently, a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at New York University, Tandon. This is a space for my experiments with tech and philosophical thoughts and monthly logs; my two cents and musings on life and tech. Here's my [journey so far <i class="fa-arrow-right icon" ></i> ](/journey.html).

Fond of tales and lore, I venture into [narrative writing](/blog/#life). I love poetry and music, indulge in [photography](/mementos.html), and dabble in [graphic design](https://dribbble.com/fuzzymf). An adventurer at heart, I travel and [explore places](https://anubhavp.dev/explored). Besides, I experiment with [tech and engineering](/blog/#tech) and attend gatherings related to space exploration and startups. More on [what I am up to <i class="fa-arrow-right icon" ></i> ](/current.html).

I'm currently based in NYC, so if you're nearby, feel free to reach out. We could chat about startups, dive into some code, or collaborate on a project.
