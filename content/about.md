Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik("fuzzymf"), a software engineer from India. Interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I try to solve real-world problems. I joined [DatingAI](https://datingai.pro) as the founding engineer and previously worked as a software engineer at [RadiusAI](https://radius.ai/) and as the founding engineer at [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com). Currently, a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at New York University, Tandon. This is a space for my philosophical thoughts and monthly updates; my two cents and musings on life and tech. Here's my [journey so far <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" ></i> ](/journey.html).

I am moving from Bangalore to Brooklyn, NYC, and am exploring the city. My friends living there tell me that the rent is exhorbitant, but the city is vibrant and full of life. Indian food would definitely be a miss.

I [write about life](https://substack.com/@fuzzymf), love poetry and music, and have recently taken up playing the guitar. I also have a penchant for [travelling, adventuring, exploring places](https://anubhavp.dev/explored), [photography](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks), and [graphic design](https://dribbble.com/fuzzymf). Fond of stories, I try to take time out to [read](https://anubhavp.dev/reading.html) more. Besides, I attend events related to space exploration and tech startups. More on [what I am up to <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right" ></i> ](/current.html).

Here's **an open invitation**: if you are in Brooklyn, let's meet over coffee. I am always up for a conversation, exploring projects and startup ideas. We can hang out and take some photos or code and build something together. Feel free to reach out over mail or any of the socials. If you want a quick chat, here are my calendar and mail links.
