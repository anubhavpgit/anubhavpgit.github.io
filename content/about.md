Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik("fuzzymf"), a software engineer from India. I am interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, and am currently working on compilers, pixel-art converters, distributed systems, high-performance caching databses, process isolation and security in Linux, LLM Ops, and [more on what I am working on  <i class="fa-arrow-right icon" ></i> ](/working.html).

I previously worked as a software engineer at [RadiusAI](https://radius.ai/) and as the founding engineer at [StackIt](https://nowstackit.com) before that. Currently, a graduate student pursuing Master's in Computer Engineering at New York University, Tandon. This site is for my monthly logs and my two cents and musings on life and tech. This is what I have worked on [so far <i class="fa-arrow-right icon" ></i> ](/journey.html).

Fond of tales and lore, I venture into [narrative writing](/blog/#life). I love poetry and music, indulge in [photography](/mementos.html), and dabble in [graphic design](https://dribbble.com/fuzzymf). Besides, I adventure, travel and explore places, experiment with [tech and engineering](/blog/#tech), and attend gatherings related to space exploration and startups. More on [what I am up to <i class="fa-arrow-right icon" ></i> ](/current.html).

I'm currently based in NYC, so if you're nearby, feel free to reach out. We could chat about startups, dive into some code, or collaborate on a project.
