Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a software engineer from India. Interested in math, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I try to solve real-world problems. I recently [left StackIt](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7145664348022013952/), where I worked as the founding engineer. Right now, I am working at RadiusAI. This is a space for my philosophical thoughts, monthly updates; my two-cents and musings on life and tech. [Here's my journey, so far](/journey.html).

[Living in Bangalore](https://anubhavp.dev/blog/lifeinametro.html) has its toll. The weather and the thriving tech scene in this city are undoubtedly appealing, but the over-population and traffic can be overwhelming. Trying to strike a balance between spending time in the office and doing things that I am more passionate about is a constant pain point.

I [write about life](https://substack.com/@fuzzymf), love poetry and music, and have recently taken up playing the guitar. I also have a penchant for [travelling, adventuring, and exploring places](https://anubhavp.dev/explored). Fond of *fiction*, I am trying to take time out to [read](https://anubhavp.dev/reading.html) more. Additionally, I have a [photography page](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks). Besides, I attend events related to space exploration, software engineering, and technology. [Here's more on what I am up to](/current.html).

Here's **an open invitation**: if you are in Bangalore, let's meet over a cup of coffee. I am always up for a conversation, exploring projects and startup ideas. We can hang out and take some photos or code together. Feel free to reach out to me over mail or any of the social media platforms. If you want to have a quick chat, here are my calendar and mail links.
