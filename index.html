                    <p> Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a CS undergrad from the <a id="link"
                            href="https://www.silicon.ac.in">Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, India</a>.
                        Interested in math, science, and engineering, I work with software engineering
                        and try to solve real-world problems.
                    </p>
                    <p> I work with whatever piques my interest. I used to dabble in ML and now work with full-stack web
                        and mobile applications. I polish my DS and algo on <a target="_blank" id="leetcode"
                            href="https://leetcode.com/anubhabr50/">Leetcode</a>.
                        Lately, I've been working on a custom bit-torrent client to download movies based on
                        recommendations from my <a target="_blank" id="mvr"
                            href="https://github.com/fuzzymfx/Movie-recommendation">movie recommendation system</a> and
                        a

                            rating prediction
                            system</a>. I'm planning to port it to Rust later. I also built a school/college
                        resource-sharing website called
                        <a target="_blank" id="resoc" href="https://notes-sit.live">resoc</a> which is under active
                        development in <a target="_blank" id="cbrtl" href="cbrtl.github.io">cbrtl</a>. I am also
                        modifying my custom SSG, <a target="_blank" id="zuzu"
                            href="https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu">zuzu</a>, to <s>port my <a
                                href="https://anubhavp.dev/paperblog">existing blog</a>, and implement a search
                            feature</s>. Meanwhile, I am also exploring <a target="_blank" id="esolang"
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">
                            esoteric programming languages
                        </a> and will be working on an brainfuck interpreter.

                        When I'm not coding up a storm, I engage with my FOSS communities. I am the co-founder of the
                        official coding club in my college, SWITCH, founded by <a
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurav-jha-4a01341b1/">Saurav Jha</a>. We
                        focus on establishing a coding community for students by conducting workshops, hackathons, and
                        coding competitions. We also provide a platform for students to showcase their skills and get
                        recognition for their work.
                        <a href="https://injuly.in"> Srijan</a> introduced me to <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://cbrtl.github.io">cbrtl</a>, a small, tight-knit group of programmers and
                        open-source sorcerers who like to craft fun projects together and
                        build a community. We are a group of developers and primarily hang out on <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://github.com/cbrtl">GitHub</a>. I was the Student Chairperson(2022-2023) of the
                        prestigious IEEE Students' Chapter, Silcion Institute. We conduct workshops, hackathons, and
                        coding competitions on a larger scale.
                    </p>

                    <p>Besides, I love listening to music, watching sci-fi, sitcoms, fantasy and thriller, and reading
                        books. I also love eating good food, taking <a href="https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks">
                            pictures</a>, and playing the guitar. I have been reading the
                        `Three Body Problem` by Liu Cixin and the
                        `A brief history of Time` by Stephen Hawking, and I hope to complete them by the end of next
                        month. I love traveling and exploring various cultures.
                        I like exploring space and I attend seminars on tech, space exploration, life in space, and
                        theoretical and quantum physics. I also participate in debates and MUNs and dabble in freelance
                        graphic design. Basically,
                        if it's geeky, nerdy, or creative, count
                        me in!
                    </p>
                    <p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/fuzzymfx">GitHub</a> and <a
