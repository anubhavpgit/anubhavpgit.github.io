                    <p> Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a CS undergrad from the <a id="link"
                            href="https://www.silicon.ac.in">Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, India</a>. I
                        am interested in math, science, and engineering. I work with software engineering
                        and try to solve real-world problems.
                    </p>
                    <p> I work with whatever I find interesting. I used to work with ML and currently I am working with
                        full-stack web and mobile applications. I polish my DS and algo on <a target="_blank"

                        I am passionate about entrepreneurship and startups and spend most of my time meddling with my
                        teams trying to host events. I am the co-founder of the official coding club in my college,
                        founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurav-jha-4a01341b1/">Saurav Jha</a> which
                        focuses on establishing a coding community for students. We conduct workshops, hackathons, and
                        coding competitions to help students learn and grow and also provide a platform for students to
                        showcase their skills and get
                        recognition for their work.

                    <p> Other than all this, I love music and watch a lot of sci-fi TV shows and movies. My favorite
                        genres are sitcoms, sci-fi, fantasy, and thriller. I like to read, eat, and<a
                            href="https://anubhavp.dev/blog "> write</a>. I click a lot
